먹튀인가요?,,,,,
Any updates??,,,,,
제가 499$ 100번째 후원자입니다. 내년이 기대되네요 개인용도로 쓰다보니 저렴한 FDA 방식을 사용하고 있었는데 이런 기회가 있어서 신청하였습니다. 차후 홈페이지에 resin도 주문할 수 있게 하면 좋을것 같아요. 지금은 작지만 튼튼한 회사가 되기를 기원합니다.,,,,,
Question...I am really wanting to print a line of fantasy gaming miniatures,,,,,
you better fix the build volume dimensions cause it should say 3.25x6x6 inches !!!!! https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/282/179/51e67370346f2eb2bee5da8f98f13542_original.png?w=680&fit=max&v=1477561388&auto=format&lossless=true&s=c971e45b538ea6d5c3256015bd110489,,,,,
Okay,,,,,
One of the comments before the campaign went live was that why not square xy plane dimensions... i guess that this have to do with the lcd panel? 7 inch lcd panel with 800x480 resolution? just my calculations... on that topic,,,,,
Love the new 3D Printer. We're a full stack crowdfunding PR Agency. Let's talk- www.spacedigitalx.com. Cheers!,,,,,

Anything new? This is last October,,,,,
후원에 참여한 후 비슷한 dlp 프린터나 관련 글들을 열심히 찾아보고 있습니다.  3d 프린터를 처음 접하다 보니 걱정이 많네요. 관련 글이나 사용기들를 읽다 보니 제일 걱정이 되는 것이 레진탱크쪽 관리와 유지비입니다. 광학필름이 장당 15달러나 한다니.. 레진만 있으면 다른 유지비 크게 신경쓰지 않고 출력이 가능한줄 알고 있었습니다. ㅠ  거기에 LCD까지 교체해야 하는 군요? ㅠ   레진 탱크쪽 관리가 DLP 프린터쪽과 어떻게 다른지 어떻게 해야 오래 잘 사용하는 지에 대한 정보가 있음 좋겠습니다. 나중에 제품을 받고 나서가 아니리 미리미리 공부하고 싶네요.,,,,,
Wohooo finally! :D,,,,,
I only see sketches and cg if the printer. Do you even have a working prototype to  show us? I want to see a video of the 3d printer printing in action.,,,,,

I want to get it. where can I find delta at kickstart. please contact me. thanks,,,,,
Will you put me down for one delta unit and let me know when you will require your early bird payment,,,,,
I have watched all of your videos and yes definitely put me down for one of your delta printer's,,,,,
How big is the build platform of this model in inches? The slides show conflicting measurements in mm and inches.,,,,,
I could like to know the delta kickstart page too ~,,,,,
안녕하세요,,,,,

If you would prefer to have a Dominion-style storage box,,,,,
If you would prefer to have a Resident Evil-style storage box,,,,,
Feel free to comment and discuss below.,,,,,
The solution for Smash Up!: The Big Geeky Box is pretty spifftastic.  Very similar to the Resident Evil solution,,,,,
A big box isn't that big of a deal. It definitely beats carrying 4 big boxes and 6 small boxes,,,,,
Resident evil box would work better for those of us who have the deck in card sleeves. I have each deck color coded so they are easily found. I'm currently using a magic the gathering holiday gift box for storage.  Only problem is it is very poorly constructed. ,,,,,
I agree with Brian Peace,,,,,
If i'm paying for it I would rather have the pretty box. I already have the jam packed box with all the separators that I made myself.,,,,,
If I wanted a pretty solution,,,,,
I dig the Dominion style. Could make it roughly the same footprint as your current boxes and just have the plastic insert that turns those spaces into rows. Wouldn't need the labels.,,,,,
Resident evil! RDI is HUGE! Compact is better.,,,,,
The Resident Evil\Divider style IMO is a better solution. This gives the players a way to sort the characters however they want to and allows additional characters to be inserted easily.,,,,,
Like both ideas,,,,,
The Resident Evil style box with dividers.,,,,,
I think the resident evil style solution is sloppy...when you take out a foam divider the cards fall all over the place,,,,,
I'm a fan of the Dominion style. I would hope that they would perhaps add a little bit of space to accomodate for sleeves,,,,,
Resident Evil / Divider Style. Whichever gets picked,,,,,
I like the organization of the Dominion box better.  Obviously there would have to be a custom slot for the Sea Deck from RDI4 in it,,,,,
resident evil box.  smaller is better.  maybe have a small box inside to hold the coins and tokens.,,,,,
I think something more like the Sentinels box,,,,,
I prefer the Dominion style box.,,,,,
I would prefer the RE styled box. Compact is key,,,,,
I liked the dominion style but did not see how the other items are  to be stored and as I like order is the main reason I like your plans for a dominion style storage solution. I own all of RD I and expansions and buttons!  It is a goto game for game nights.,,,,,
As others have said smash up did the big box with its deck dividers and it's amazing. It's only failure is no organization for the tokens. And books.,,,,,
Resident evil box with an option to purchase upgrades in the form of deck boxes for the different characters.  One of the spacers could be a cardboard box that hold all the tokens and assorted loose items with the play mats stored on top.  Also,,,,,

This is awesome!  Perfect for those who would like to learn the game!,,,,,
Is it me or I think that in the sea region (small islands),,,,,
Josh we can get a head start,,,,,
I just would like my physical copy to show up.,,,,,
best post so far <3,,,,,
I love Facebook's random glitches:,,,,,
If you back The Queen so you can also get the base game,,,,,
I would like to know where in the Original campaign did it say that any of the stretch goals unlocked were exclusive to KS backers. Nowhere on the campaign page does it say this. Usually stretched goals are marked if they are KS exclusive. For example all of the stretch goals in herbaceous are in the retail game. It doesnt mean that they are part of a strect goal that they are exclusive,,,,,
Will the metal coins be available at retail later? I definitely want to back the solo game,,,,,
I'm interested but I want to be able to get everything from the 1st KS as I'm a completionist. If I'm going to be missing a chunk of promo cards then I'm unlikely to back. Has it been confirmed yet if they are definitely going to be available?,,,,,
I'd prefer to play the base game first.,,,,,
It's a lot of fun,,,,,
So this launches at midnight? What time zone?,,,,,
So excited for this!,,,,,
I thought you need to have either a Pawn or a Feudum as entry to a guild before locations can increase your standing? They seem to be playing here that locations give them guild standing even without Pawns/Feudums.,,,,,
Hi Mickaël Rémondière... I'm working with JR Honeycutt on a solo mode.. this takes time. : ),,,,,
Had to cancel mine,,,,,
Quick question... is the mermaid and things that come with the expansion 3D models/minis as shown in the video or are they cardboard or something?,,,,,
Still no solo mode until the ks ends please ?,,,,,
I didn't see it but let me guess,,,,,
Sorry,,,,,
I wish people would stop giving this man money.,,,,,
How much did they pay you for your 'opinion'? I just can't take anything he says serious.,,,,,
Christopher Heinhold,,,,,
Aidan Leslie Cole,,,,,
I don't know how I'm going to wait until October to play this.... Any chance you'd consider a print at home version for backers?... So we can play while we wait...lol,,,,,
Afonso Bernardino,,,,,
To be honest... i didnt read description of the game ... but I saw that sweet monster figure ... soooo lovely :) couldnt help :) needed to back up that project :D,,,,,
Pledged. So beautiful ! But I can't decide to buy addons or the coins ... really expensive :( I want it mainly for solo purpose,,,,,

Necesito este juego ya!!,,,,,
Mark Swanson You need to somehow get your game to the writers of The Big Bang Theory. If the characters played it in their show,,,,,
Very cool commercial! When is it available to buy?,,,,,
Really excited! See you on launch day!,,,,,
Ready for the Ks :),,,,,
Looks awesome!,,,,,
Too long playing for us. -(. Looks awesome though.,,,,,
Jonny Newbould,,,,,
Can't get this game out of my head.  It's grueling just waiting for the kickstarter campaign to start,,,,,
Whoa,,,,,
Extremely well done KS project,,,,,
Perry,,,,,
Ledi Nozor looks like a game for you,,,,,
That video snippet is really well done.,,,,,
Alex and Catherine,,,,,
Before I put the sound on I was expecting GoT music,,,,,
"Have the ""farms"" been revised?  Last year in the game I played I burned a lot of resources and time to build a farm thinking that it would produce a lot of food (as farms tend to do) only to find out it was a random pull from a bag and 90% of everything I ""harvested"" was not food.",,,,,
Eye catching video. Nice job.,,,,,
Looks fun. I was sold the moment I saw the big blue unicorn thing,,,,,
Keep me informed.,,,,,
Do you have prototypes of this?   I would love to review it.,,,,,
Sooo after KS what is the projected ship date? Are we looking at 2017 or 2018?,,,,,

Awesome video!,,,,,
Tim Harvey - flying buddy!,,,,,
On a Mac what would you use to do the slow motion please?,,,,,
Typical.  I only bought the previous model last year. Can’t afford to buy another one. ☺️😩,,,,,
See how this thing would do on a couple of runs down Flagstaff B En .,,,,,
Julie Rayner where you filmed by one of these?,,,,,
Don’t be fooled by the foreground railings appearing to vibrate. This effect is not vibration but foreground displacement caused by changes in the camera elevation as the bike bounces up and down. The horizon remains pretty stable.,,,,,
Nothing but good luck from my Fly6 and Fly12. We use it every road ride.,,,,,
Steven Ball pretty cool this camera,,,,,
If that was me it would need a built in somersault correction,,,,,

Just got my ne FLY 12 CE - why did Cycliq remove all the great mobile app functionality such as being able to view/edit your videos and add screen overlays like tram lines,,,,,
I received a Fly6 for Christmas. It will not charge,,,,,
Ahhhh,,,,,
Martyn Vessey Joel Phillips want one?!,,,,,
May I respectfully suggest you put together a package of 'near hits' (I won't call them near misses) a d send it off to the like of Dash Cam Australia.  It would achieve three things. 1.  Make drivers aware (fearful?) cyclists have cameras,,,,,
At the mark of 1:41 Kerry E. Waldman...,,,,,
Is there a way to flag the footage so it doesn't get written over?,,,,,
I can’t wait to get my fly 6ce are they shipping them out yet ?,,,,,
No animals were asked to risk their lives in the making of this video. All lighting is made w/ Fluorescent ceiling bulbs.,,,,,
Sorry a little swearing 🤬,,,,,
Does Cycliq plan its own platform for video up load?,,,,,

Phillip Tehan,,,,,
Is great footage,,,,,
I just purchased the Fly 6(v) after a couple of incidents. I know it won’t stop an accident but I feel a lot happier knowing I now have footage of incidents. Saving up for the front cam.,,,,,
What unit is being shown in this video? Is this something new?,,,,,
Yea how come this model is not available? Is it a 1080p rear cam?,,,,,
Is there a bundled kit... front and rear?,,,,,
Best safety investment I have made for my cycling. I have both the Fly6 and Fly12.,,,,,
Local police used to have a vehicle parked inthe area for just such an incident. On every ride at this intersection someone is breaking law,,,,,
Cadel says if you want to stay alive on the roads then dont ever ever go to Australia on a cycling holiday.,,,,,
Mitch Wheeler Trent Jose the end haha nice to see him riding in the middle off the road imagine being in a car stuck behind him,,,,,
Gavin Peter  I think this is one of those must have purchases,,,,,
Cadel is a beast on road and mountain bikes. Miss seeing him in the peloton,,,,,
Lol that guy at the end would have been fine if he stayed left. (1m from car doors),,,,,

Let's see what we can make. We are going te be creative!,,,,,
W.I.L.L. the professor looks awesome - and I was already kicking myself for not getting the darkside bundle add-on with my kickstarter pledge! Will the bundle be available anywhere else? I want those characters and cards! :),,,,,
Really looking forward to DW!,,,,,
You need to give more information about gameplay,,,,,
I've been so eager for this. Can't wait.,,,,,
Do you already know who will be casting the miniatures?,,,,,
This looks very cool and I like the fact that it handles up to eight players. Many games top out at four or five and so often my gaming group has to play a couple of games instead of one. What is 'supporter list' that you mention in your rewards? Take care and good luck :),,,,,
Why are there no treasure cards? Is this one of those games that you only can get items in between each quest?,,,,,
Isn't the time incorrect? Rome should be six hours ahead of NY. so that if it's Midnight EDT,,,,,

Emmanuel GaGu,,,,,
Oooo!  I can't wait to see all the ideas from your customers that you have put into this new Undress!  I'll be on tomorrow,,,,,
I thought this dress would be awesome,,,,,
What time today will it be live on Kickstarter?,,,,,
Sorry,,,,,
I am unsure how this video is supposed to be a teaser for the Version 3? No part of this video even gives me a glimpse into what the new and improved features of this dress will be.,,,,,
I'm curious as to why you continue to do Kickstarters for each version? Shouldn't your following be enough to know that what you produce next will also work?,,,,,
So I thought it was supposed to be launched today but I can't find it on kickstarter?,,,,,
it's not really a teaser if we only see the dress hanging out of a car window. the teaser emails we've been getting gave more info,,,,,
Do not see anything listed for the Undress on today's schedule on the Kickstarter site.,,,,,
I can't wait to see it.  I want to share it and let people know your company is a reliable Kickstarter company,,,,,
WOOHOO!!! Love it The Undress!!!!,,,,,
Super excited to take this next step with y'all!!,,,,,
Teaser,,,,,
I just tried to go to Kickstarter,,,,,
Ahhhhh!!! Can't wait!!! I'll be checking in tomorrow for sure!! 🙌🏻,,,,,
The Kickstarter is online now!  http://kck.st/2qbeRJH,,,,,
It's live on Kickstarter now,,,,,
I love my The Undress.  I have the mint one with the black and white stripes.  I am excited to see the updates.  It is a wonderful concept.  I use mine mainly during the summer as I take a water aerobics class.,,,,,
How long before we get to see the actual product????,,,,,
I'd rather have a link to the kickstarter campaign than a video that doesn't show anything.,,,,,
Can't wait!!!!!,,,,,
So close! 👍🏼,,,,,
OMG! I need to squeeze him!,,,,,
He's so cute! Happy Thanksgiving Dennis to you and yours!,,,,,

I'm an original backer with 1st undress & sport. Last night I backed you for 2 undercovers. I love you guys and your innovativeness!!,,,,,
LOVE YOU GUYS! Love the UNDERCOVER! Soooo excited about it and about your success! PS - Lei is looking forward to being a model for one of your undress/undercover shoots/videos one of these days so keep that/her in mind! ;),,,,,
Congrats!,,,,,

Mark,,,,,
There was a bottle of wine in a locked glass in this little restaurant/bar in the middle of nowhere in Spain (November 2011) so my travel buddy and I assumed it had to be expensive. They did not speak English at the place so we just pointed and hoped for the best when they rang it up. We read the receipt and had to adjust in our heads because Europeans use commas where we use the decimal point,,,,,
A great story! That sounds like it was fun and the bottle is a nice addition to your display. Might even work as example for a sketch for this novice artist.,,,,,
Yes!! 😍 Well done 👌,,,,,
I bought a pair of boots at the Tipsy Trunk Sale. They are sooo comfortable!  I love them!!,,,,,

梗係領袖卡啦，每位議員都有自己技能，好似三國殺咁，增加左難度同變化，令每一個行動都要深思熟慮，留意其他人嘅手牌同場上嘅資源同建築物，防止其他人放喑箭同時自己要出奇不意。 如果角色平行做得好， 絕對會係最好嘅擴充。Ching Sze Kaito Chan Chang Yu Hon Anthony Ho Kiu Kyle Au,,,,,

Please tell us news about outdoor camera,,,,,
Here is or alarm😜. But is your alarm also LAN,,,,,
When is the keypad being shipped out?,,,,,
HomeKit please!!,,,,,
You can control iSmartAlarm with Alexa,,,,,
We want  an automatic call option. Germany!,,,,,
I still can’t add the camera.  So fed up of this.  When I first bought the system it took hours to get the camera working. When I tried to add a new camera the whole thing messed up. Now all it had added is the door sensor.,,,,,
I'd like to remove the panic button completely and replace it again. I used to be able to. Now,,,,,
I'm so happy that we can now have more control of the upset cameras. Thank you!!!,,,,,
nice,,,,,
Syncing with Apple Watch does not work. Please change urgently,,,,,
"We need to be able to do this on the ""Disarm"" button as well!",,,,,
HomeKit??,,,,,
Ike Robb,,,,,
Un bug sur le cubeOne qui commence a me mettre les nerfs a vif,,,,,
Vous pourriez donner des nouvelles sur le bug du logiciel de la version beta.,,,,,
Why doesn't this work for the EU version of the iCamera Keep?!?!?!,,,,,
Please release a doorbell camera :-D,,,,,
Miguel Do Fundo 😉,,,,,
Mia ... opgradering af begge kameraer koster totalt 190$. Lad os lige snakke om det.,,,,,
is this system compatible with any outdoor cameras,,,,,
Pretty sad that they have time to make videos like this but not ship my order which is almost a month late 👎👎👎,,,,,
Toujours rien pour la France,,,,,
It's great! I want to order 2 more after my 2 Kickstarter Spots arrived this week,,,,,
How do we view the continuous recorded video content stored locally on the SD card? My spot is mounted high up on a wall so it would be very difficult to uninstall my spot from the wall every time I need to view the continuous recorded video. Thanks!.,,,,,
Who would ever want to tell their dogs to get off the couch!,,,,,
There should be an alarm built into it as well.,,,,,
ismartdog ?,,,,,
Jason Bahrt,,,,,
Is spot a wireless application or does it need to be plugged in like iCamera keep?,,,,,
you mean they don't sleep the whole time we are gone? LOL,,,,,
Great product!  But what about the IFTTT-channel. I can't connect since last week.,,,,,
You guys looking for any beta testers?,,,,,
Are these compatible w/outside use?,,,,,
Looks very nice,,,,,
Can you view the stream directly from the cloud account or do you have to setup port forwarding when viewing the stream from outside the network?,,,,,
I hope you had a safe wonderful Easter,,,,,
TY back atcha,,,,,
When is the siren coming out??,,,,,
Have you managed to sort out a UK version?,,,,,
Exciting.,,,,,

Release date?,,,,,

anymore updates on when presale will be?,,,,,
Sorry that is ugly. I'm sure it's functional. But :$,,,,,
That is fast. Nice. Does it work with SD card too or only USB,,,,,
What is it?,,,,,
OMG that thing is ugly.,,,,,
Do u have one,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,
OMG <3,,,,,
"I like the camera big. I WANT people to know I got their picture and it's sent up to the cloud and I want the camera to talk to them and say ""GOTCHA F**KER!""",,,,,
Great product,,,,,
The camera is too big also should sense and take pic,,,,,
Love the new video!,,,,,

What do you think they are saying to each other?  This is adorable.,,,,,
Miguel Angel Maria Tony Flores Lily Merino Flores I want to get something like this for the kids??,,,,,
Great idea.,,,,,
Happy birthday baby Amy!!!!!,,,,,
Vea Alejandro Marin,,,,,
Celine Chin,,,,,
Something similar to this could be used for children left in hot cars!,,,,,
Need this to keep track of my husband while in sporting goods stores... if he goes out of range *alarm sounds* saving me so much money,,,,,
Last year at Disney world I watched a little girl get separated from her parents,,,,,
I'm curious,,,,,
does it work with the IPHONE 7? the small print only lists up to 6s,,,,,
I'd like the alarm to go off so the child can hear it too and  return to the beach area THEN !!!,,,,,
iPhone 7s and galaxy 7? And does it matter what carrier?,,,,,
I would assume it would work in reverse as in if the parents went too far away. So having this on your child's ankle would help parents remember if they accidentally left their kid in the car.,,,,,
What about pools?,,,,,
Is there an alarm if the child takes it off by themselves?,,,,,
How hard is it for the child to remove?,,,,,
Can u use this at a public pool.,,,,,
That is cool. I wonder how much?,,,,,
I have 4 young kiddos 2 high special needs could I get 4 and be linked to my phone together?  Or will only 1 work at a time?,,,,,
Does it work in areas with no cell coverage? Some beaches don't have strong  cell coverage.,,,,,
As a caregiver for an Alzheimer's patient this would also be great! My great Aunt lived in a house joining ours but we couldn't tell when she got out of the house or wandered too far from the house. Having one of these would have been great!!',,,,,
I see a lot of people saying just watch your child. I had a hold of my child's hand she let go and got lost in a big crowd within seconds. I was terrified this would have helped me locate her quicker,,,,,
You should make it look like a cool watch that kids would like to wear without them knowing it is keeping track of them.  Some kids just take off...would alert parents when they wander off or just take off.,,,,,
Is it a watch as well? Or just a wristband?,,,,,
This would also work for people that have pools that our accessible to young kids.  Good job MyBuddyTag.com .,,,,,
How easy would it be for a kid to take it off? Put this on a kid and tell them not to take it off. Even say it is a cool bracelet. But some kids will take it off anyways.,,,,,
I am wondering if this can 'grow' with the child,,,,,
My Buddy Tag,,,,,
Julia Abaroa Connor remember me wanting to invent this? Anita Martin.... yup someone finally came out with it,,,,,
Kelli Olson Danielle Reinert Michelle Irwin I want all three of you to look at this and get back to me privately,,,,,
Any idea when the people who did kickstarter will be receiving their joey tags?,,,,,

So it cant be cut off?,,,,,
I want two of them please,,,,,

Is it water proof?,,,,,
Why does it only track for 100yards?,,,,,
Is it water proof and how easy is it to cut the band?,,,,,
Gps tracking needs to be a broader area. Kids are fast,,,,,
How is this different than the Buddy Tag?,,,,,
Gwen Garza,,,,,
Russell Burns.  Kinda cool,,,,,
I want one of these! Several reasons!,,,,,
100 meters.,,,,,
The only problem I have with this is the lack of range on the GPS... for instance in a kidnapping situation,,,,,

Minchia..... che mancanza di immaginazione.,,,,,
I remember seeing one of the first paintings you posted of this series and immediately thought how cool it was that you're painting the wrapping but then I looked again and saw that it did look 3d on the canvas edges and was (stupidly) fooled at the time as I didn't think about you adding anything to the edges. Always so damn impressed at how real you make it look! And so damn proud you are from AUS!! :D <3,,,,,
great,,,,,
Amazing talent.  God bless,,,,,

Great idea,,,,,
Think you just painted one of mine!! Lol.,,,,,
Rob,,,,,
I wish we could see this exhibition here in Adelaide.,,,,,
Such a pertinent statement on how we are shaped by society,,,,,
People photographed themselves holding their piece in their photo?!  Haha just looking top right if the painting,,,,,
I hope there aren't too many 'technical' tiles. Have you counted how many are unusual or unexpected?,,,,,
Thanks for including us in the process. Can we get a print of the final piece?,,,,,
Sorry if I missed the explanation   Are you painting where the pieces are missing?,,,,,
Un saludo desde buenos aires,,,,,
Proud of myself I cropped properly but I like the fact some aren't,,,,,
Robin will you have prints of this when you come to adelaide,,,,,

Mine also hasn't arrived yet,,,,,
Such a beautiful painting,,,,,
It looks amazing. Thrilled to be part of it. 😊,,,,,
So excited to see the next stage And to have a small piece of your magic.,,,,,
Yes I was curious about that too Darren Rolf.  I was tempted to alter at least one of my pieces but figured a lot of other people would try and personalise theirs,,,,,
Wow that's a lot that never arrived.........,,,,,
Robin,,,,,
Ooh it looks great. So exciting,,,,,
Denise Pierobon,,,,,
Bravo buddy 👌🏻,,,,,
Declan - this is the project we contributed to!,,,,,
Love it. I can clearly see me & my son with his bedroom mural I painted in the bottom right corner!!   Hazel Barnes,,,,,
I love it! I'm thrilled that my little piece is in there somewhere :D I bet it will be lovely to re-paint such an emotive subject.,,,,,
Soooooo cool! ❤️❤️❤️,,,,,
I got my little piece today! This is the only downside of living in the paradise that is rural Spain! So sorry I won't be able to get it back to you,,,,,
Harder game than 'Where's Wally' but finally found my pieces :D,,,,,
Ah man,,,,,
How important is the amount of pressure you apply to the brush to get different values or hues from the color in the end of your brush?,,,,,
Great work Rob! Quick question,,,,,
When you're rendering texture or details do you find dabbing the brush more useful or scumbling back and forth with out picking up the brush from the surface?,,,,,
You say nor time efficient but seems to me you complete paintings fast! As fair as photorealism goes in oils.,,,,,
Hi Robin this is looking great! Was thinking of doing your workshop...but I haven't painted before (only digital). Will it be too advanced for me?,,,,,
Do you always use the same size paintbrush and what are you painting on? Does it help with proportion?,,,,,
I just think your work is astounding. I have a friend who does wonderful portraits too.,,,,,
Cool thank you for that - Are you working from a photo reference that's printed or from a monitor,,,,,
So happy to hear you're doing workshops in Aus again! Looking lovelyyy 👌🏽🤗,,,,,
Excited about The Art Academy starting again. I'll certainly be there in July!,,,,,
So you have gone from dark hair to the light background....did you clean it off,,,,,
I'm very curious on what colours exactly do you use to give skin tone,,,,,
Robin..have.you mentioned dates for July workshops...,,,,,
I'm sorry if you've repeated this already but are you using any mediums right now?,,,,,
Like the analogy. I will try to incorporate it as I take ages :-),,,,,
Thanks man. What kind of brush are you using?,,,,,
Hello Robin...good to see.you online 😀,,,,,
How many brushes are you using,,,,,
Are you using a medium Robin,,,,,
Ha...ok...thank you Robin,,,,,
Yay,,,,,
What about umbers?,,,,,
As far*,,,,,
Hi...,,,,,
Beautiful work,,,,,

"whats it like working with the ''art world"" at your level? Im not involved with any art community and im a bit apprehensive to do so.",,,,,
Is there ever a disconnect between color,,,,,
Very cool! Your method...not necessarily the subject! Look forward to what you do with it,,,,,
Got it.  Did you have to pay for the image or snagged it off a news show or something?,,,,,
How can you afford to do that? Give away pieces of the painting...,,,,,
I would be very interested to do your workshop too,,,,,

The drummer is excellent ! His playing litteraly made my songs come to life. Can't wait to share the final product with you !,,,,,
Ridiculously tight playing,,,,,
@Jean-Sébastien Goyette  He is the drummer of mystery. It's the canadian prog rock band that I toured with last september ! I rarely see a more powerful drummer than him :-P,,,,,
Nice! I wonder if he has heard of Sammy j Watson. Something about his playing reminds me of it. Could be just a prog way if playing.,,,,,
@Jean-Sébastien Goyette,,,,,
Yessss sounds amazing,,,,,

Nice that you can whack the ice away like that.  Most shovels edge would curl or bend if you did that.,,,,,
Beast mode on that ice!,,,,,
Wouldnt go in the backcountry with out it! It also shovels my driveway soooooo good! All around amazing product.,,,,,
Where's the shovel?,,,,,
"This is the ""bestist"" video!",,,,,
My Toyota will out dig 98% of you shit talking Chevy owners!,,,,,
If it was a subaru you wouldn't need a shovel,,,,,
Hahaha.  A 4Runner getting stuck...  that's a good one 😂,,,,,
Except she wasn't stuck to begin with.,,,,,
My Chevy would have backed right out of that buy American 4x4 not foreign.,,,,,
No way she shoveled the whole road flat,,,,,
Ditch the shovel and buy a real 4x4.,,,,,
Great idea untill she drags it down the side of your truck.,,,,,
Should have showed her high centered then dig her self out.,,,,,
She wasent stuck,,,,,
Or ya could just chain up.,,,,,

Is your Christmas Hallelujah song on a purchasable CD?  Only finding downloads to purchase.  I'm old school and still love my CDs!,,,,,
Cloverton,,,,,
I have the Cloverton Christmas version of Hallelujah on CD. Ordered it from Family Christian Bookstore a couple of years ago. My very favorite!,,,,,
The Cloverton Christmas Hallelujah is now my favorite song.  I listen to it each morning while getting ready for work.  Such wonderful talent!,,,,,
We have been praying for you all now for over 3 years and have attended 4 concerts.  This is not a stopping point.  Having faith you will reach your goal. Blessings to you.,,,,,

The leader is very useful with more than 4 cavers,,,,,
The heal expensive for self,,,,,
Doesn't the bodyguard protect the others from the tremor?,,,,,
You forgot to move the horror twice also 😆😆😆,,,,,
How much life does he hv? Doesnt need to heal right,,,,,
Explore again? What r the chances of your hand drawing bad tiles?,,,,,
Is this the normal difficulty setting?,,,,,
Keep going started now. This game seems full of risks lol y not,,,,,
Direct the red and let the red do the heavy works,,,,,
The bodyguard don't protect from tremor?,,,,,
How many gas tiles,,,,,
Apprently not,,,,,
Oh wait now theyve gone the way we ddnt wanna,,,,,
Thank you,,,,,
Get away from the horror monster thing!!!,,,,,
I hate the left path yet the right not better lol 😂,,,,,
Engineer should've exerted to heal,,,,,

Exciting to get the game from kickstater,,,,,
To clarify puzzle 3,,,,,
Have any questions for Dan? Drop them in the comments below!,,,,,
Can we have more explanation on the 3rd puzzle,,,,,
For Cypher B,,,,,
Funny thing is that the 3d cypher could be solved just by ungrouping the 3d-shape. Once you did that,,,,,
Cypher B file get color degenerated when uploaded to twitter and we can't find any secret messages,,,,,
Really a pity that first three cyphers were time-limited :( I noticed that the 4th puzzle appeared only on the last day and there were no more Google Forms or anything :(  BTW,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,
I've tried the jpg and png version for Cypher B,,,,,
What was the pm I got asking for a username all about?,,,,,
So,,,,,
Hi Dan ;-),,,,,
I still don't understand stage 1 of puzzle 3. 😕,,,,,
Also,,,,,
Is there someplace else where they are answering questions that people have about their solutions? I'm a little disappointed that they haven't been more responsive here. Many people spent days or even weeks working through their puzzles,,,,,
I had a feeling that there were multiple ways to arrive at the solution for stage 1 of puzzle 3. My solution involved re-ordering input 1 based on population,,,,,
All six cities that are starred on the map also have corresponding correct values in input 2 and input 3. Of the 10 cities,,,,,
Congratulations and commiserations to all that entered! Emails will be on their way with details to all winners soon!,,,,,
YOU SAID MY NAME!!! So excited right now,,,,,

Again.  Congrats on the win. Sub Terra is an awesome game that really hits the spot with tension and suspense,,,,,
Hello,,,,,
I never realised i wanted to see this until i started watching *addicted* 😮,,,,,
I agree - i'm finding these totally entrancing. As someone who has dreams of getting the game i'm working on into production,,,,,
What's with the suspenseful 'horror ending'? Elastic bands! Won't they think of the children!? :O,,,,,
I'm loving these how-i's-made videos. Keep them coming.,,,,,
"So that's what ""to the printer"" looks like!",,,,,
What cardgame?,,,,,
Oddly relaxing to watch,,,,,
Peter is still in China until Sunday (and Chinese internet does not love facebook),,,,,
This is the most therapeutic thing I've seen all day,,,,,
I can't wait for all my copies of Mined Out to be gut punched by that terrifying machine!,,,,,
Amazing how easy the machine makes it look. Thanks ITB for the info-Bomb,,,,,
Amazing stuff!,,,,,
I could watch this all day,,,,,
I can't get the pledge manager thing to work,,,,,
So... What game was it for at the end?,,,,,
Would have loved to be there but am working 😢,,,,,
Sorry I couldn't go in the end. Had a late work session.,,,,,

wow just noticed you hit target on day one too - get-in. huge well done,,,,,
Happy playtime..,,,,,
There's nothing to find but darkness...muahahaha,,,,,
Thats the one!,,,,,
Have you literally set them to working in the mines?,,,,,
I really wanna play now,,,,,
Even though I passed out in a plume of noxious gas,,,,,
The base looks pretty chunky: will you still be able to fit a whole team on one tile?,,,,,
Bloody cracking!,,,,,
I like the elevated base.,,,,,
Love it!,,,,,
Gorgeous,,,,,
Looks great!,,,,,
Looks awesome!,,,,,
WHERES THE BEARD!?,,,,,

Congratulations Kevin!,,,,,

Yes - is the UV arms that are so exciting - although there are a number of settings where the higher intensity lighting will be useful,,,,,
More excitement for photographers.,,,,,
Can’t wait!!! UV here we come!,,,,,

I love the 878 Vikings expansions and how modular they are,,,,,
I think games for the younger set would be great!,,,,,
Gameplay balancing is so challenging and time consuming!!! Well done video,,,,,
Thank you!,,,,,
Awesome video,,,,,
Any solo expansion stuff coming for Guadalcanal?,,,,,
Thank you...can't wait!,,,,,
Any tentative release date for the Crusades?,,,,,
Any more games in birth of Europe coming?,,,,,
Any new “birthplace” games following Vikings that are new and not expansions?,,,,,
Thanks!,,,,,
Birth of series is a fantastic system!,,,,,
Crusades? YEAAAA!!!,,,,,
Conflict of Heroes DDay/Normandy release?  French and German 1940?,,,,,
You all are one of my all time favorite game companies! Please tell Uwe my students and I eagerly await Gettysburg.,,,,,
There is not one game company with which I would rather work for a living than Academy Games...it speaks to my degree in History and Economics and my passion for great games,,,,,
It's truly miraculous how well Academy Games weds its educational mission to really solid and well designed games.  Usually you have to pick one or the other.,,,,,
Just another great reason to like Academy Games!!,,,,,
We're watching the comments for your questions!,,,,,
WELL CRAP! Wish I would have noticed this was going on. Maybe next time as I just subscribed to the Academy Games You Tube channel,,,,,
CoH new solo expansions...,,,,,
Music to my ears,,,,,
Have you thought about using an AI deck for the cops. Where both players have to deal with them?,,,,,
Hi Gunter! Good to see you.,,,,,
Are you planning any more campaigns fir Awakening the Bear solo? Or winter versions of the maps?,,,,,
Yep,,,,,
I actually meant the next standalone expansion box not the expansions in this Kickstarter..,,,,,
What s in the future for conflict of heroes?,,,,,
ACW and the new Scientist Fi game sound really interesting,,,,,
As a Belgian I L O V E France 40 both in places as in hardware of that period,,,,,
Birth... of... Sol... 😍🤤,,,,,
Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon,,,,,
Cool,,,,,
Cool,,,,,

Ian: “I’m going to tell you about all the reasons why you should be excited for Dualosaur Island. Because I’m excited for it.” **VIDEO ENDS**  That would have been awesome.,,,,,
When is the Kickstarter for this?,,,,,
Come on then pandasaurus games. We are a week away from the mysterious dualasaurus island Kickstarter......let’s see some more teasers 🙂. Having picked up my dinosaur island at retail I’d love to see an upgrade pledge where I can get the Dino meeples,,,,,
Looking forward to trying that one,,,,,
DRAMATIC,,,,,
So excited for this.,,,,,
I will have dis!!!,,,,,
You will not be alone!,,,,,
Looks like a great birthday present for me. 😊,,,,,
Available for essen pick up?,,,,,
Are you going to be making expansions that release more awesome coaster parts? A functional corkscrew would be awesome!,,,,,
David Edwards,,,,,
This is looking awesome!!,,,,,
And beautiful Kwanchai Moriya art by the looks of it!,,,,,
Does the WEDS essen pick up include the promo pack?,,,,,
Is this getting a conventional distribution release? What's the MSRP?,,,,,
Only steel coasters? :/,,,,,
Looking good! Ville,,,,,
Looks great! Are there more video's coming?,,,,,
Will this game be getting a general release as well or is it only available direct from Pandasaurus?,,,,,
Brian Dickens...,,,,,
Beautiful day for a cup on the patio.,,,,,
Oof stay dry!   Not sure if it's something to do with the new site but I'm trying to email and it's bouncing...,,,,,
Y'all started a craze with your traze!   (Yes,,,,,
Glad I got to be part of that line yesterday!,,,,,
Can't wait to receive my preorder!,,,,,
Hoping some are left by Friday morning,,,,,
How many copies will be available at Gen Con?,,,,,
Excited to see this at Gen Con this summer!  Definitely hoping to get a ticket to one of the events.,,,,,
I want!,,,,,
I was just about to ask if the card trays fit sleeved cards and then you answered me. Thanks!,,,,,
How long is clean up?,,,,,
Are the game trays going to be in the retail version?,,,,,
That's what's being advertised on sites like csi,,,,,
That's a lot of punch boards! Very exciting can't wait until they all ship out. Should do another Wasteland Wednesday to show it off,,,,,
Candice we need to find a way to get this game into South Africa.,,,,,
Sweet !!!,,,,,
It looks fab!,,,,,
Reall looking forward to getting my hands on a copy!,,,,,
Super stoked,,,,,
I love how everythinng is organized!,,,,,
Well,,,,,

Hype hype hype HYPE,,,,,
Ache Bonifacio,,,,,
Any updates on the release/shipment date for the pre-orders?,,,,,
awsome work gamptrayz....,,,,,

Above and beyond what I anticipated!,,,,,
Tyler Wates Jake Mullen,,,,,
A lot of components,,,,,
Too cool,,,,,
Shawn Cosby look at the game organization!!,,,,,
Does this hold card sleeves? Be a damn shame to have to chuck 1/2 the insert.,,,,,
Gorgeous!,,,,,
Soooon. At least I hope. 😄,,,,,
Impressive - so can i get this right... Game Trayz does the tray design with your oversight and Panda GM does all the manufacturing?,,,,,
That's what the future of boardgames should be? Better inserts and trays to secure the components while transit or quick setups before game session. Way to go Pandassaurus!!! Give them an awards!,,,,,
Edward Norton?,,,,,
That's what I call an insert.,,,,,
Ben Morrison,,,,,
Is this a KS exclusive,,,,,
The minis and cargo really add the theme of the game and player immersion.,,,,,
Yes this looks awesome!,,,,,
Colin Toke,,,,,
I can't wait to paint them.,,,,,

Zach Bates,,,,,

Neil Speas 😸,,,,,
Haaaaaaa lol,,,,,
Simone Romano Nunzio Gabriele Surace finalmente!,,,,,
is this included in the KS version? Im so freaking confused all the time what hero pack and what expansions are in the KS,,,,,
Axel Murcielago prepei grigora na paiksoume mazi to campaign ,,,,,
"SO the expansion has a proper insert while it was ""not necessary"" and ""too expensive"" for the base game?",,,,,
When will it be available in EU?,,,,,
Now,,,,,
Beautiful!,,,,,
...and maybe this awesome box,,,,,
Jota Dias ai ja tem expansão,,,,,
Tim Parnell,,,,,
David Winter,,,,,
Love the tripod designs,,,,,
"Why are there photos of WW2 planes? Are those rules ""supported"" in Tripods as well?",,,,,
Absolutely love the tripods and hope they get released commercially and I wish you every success but sorry I'm not doing another kickstarter ever again,,,,,
Will the aircraft models be different than the WoG releases by any chance?,,,,,
Frederico Amaral,,,,,
Where is hunt for the ring? Still waiting 😕,,,,,

Yo quiero uno regálenmelo 😑😑😑😑😑😑,,,,,
Please do not condemn the art/story to coffee-tablehood by making it oversized. Keep it affordable,,,,,
Whatever is typical for the average children's picture story book would be great. I would love to use it for programs. I will be backing it on kickstarter for sure!,,,,,
Looks fantastic!  Absolutely beautiful.  I'd go as big as is manageable for a parent/child combo to comfortably hold and read.  I'm looking forward to buying this to share with my family.,,,,,
"I've decided on hardcover - something in the 9""x12"" size",,,,,
This is great :),,,,,

I love mine I received it,,,,,
Her eyes when the rope comes off  - so funny!,,,,,
My labs absolutely love water bottles and the noise they make when crunching them,,,,,
Your videos are always fun and teachful!!! It was nice to see Jazzy & Coopy! 😘 🙆 ❤,,,,,
Now if we could just teach all people to recycle.,,,,,
Great idea!  Since my dogs and I are stuck inside because of Irma,,,,,
I can't help but smile!,,,,,
I love her look at you when the strap comes off.  Too funny.  Ive got to work with mimi on this.,,,,,
"That look when she pulled off the handle!  LOL  Coopie's satisfied ""whoo"" <3",,,,,
I really enjoy your account,,,,,
Hope things are going better with her!,,,,,
Bloopers are the best!,,,,,
Love love love ❤️ it all 👏🏻❤️👍🏼😉,,,,,
This video made my day!!!,,,,,
Love it!,,,,,
Have you seen the Bob-a-lot? Love interactive food dispenser.,,,,,
I had a Kong Wobbler I would use to feed Razor from. Had to refill it a couple of times for him to get his full meal,,,,,
Donna Here's a way to get Skye to eat and keep her busy!,,,,,
You are so clever!  Perfect for BB...  How is she doing?  Have the meds helped?  Did you visit the specialist yet?,,,,,
So cute! She is a happy dog!!,,,,,
Robyn Pepin,,,,,
Can I share?  :),,,,,
Great idea! I bought pit balls to fill a laundry basket for the same. Will sure make this too! 😍,,,,,
Clever! I have never heard of one...But Daki and Zoey will soon have one! Thank you so much!  You are the most creative person I know!,,,,,
Eric Dion,,,,,
Nice. How do you wash it when needed,,,,,
I wish!! My shredder would loooove to get ahold of that fleece.,,,,,
Lots easier than filling kong.,,,,,
Tea Selakovic did you say you had extra dog blankets? Here's an idea. 😄,,,,,
I am making this soon!,,,,,
Great idea!!,,,,,
Love this idea,,,,,
Genius!!!,,,,,
Mandy Southwell,,,,,
Robyn Pepin,,,,,
Thank you Aki for posting your videos ....love and learn from them 😘🙂!!,,,,,
Awwwww,,,,,
Love the videos. Thanks for sharing!,,,,,
So love to see your work.   Loved seeing Jazzy.  So beautiful both your girls!,,,,,
Love this!! The tail wag is adorable! Your girls are so beautiful. 😍,,,,,
Love seeing BB!,,,,,
Jazzy never fails to make me smile and get a little teary eyed...  Thanks for sharing!,,,,,
Love these videos!,,,,,
Mimi's got that one down.,,,,,
Robyn Pepin 💕💕,,,,,
Kara Nicole,,,,,
Tristan Smith,,,,,
What was on the floor that she wanted? Would she come to you if you call her?  My dog is obessed with next door dog. Would go to the fence and run along fence even if there is no dog on the other side. We started working on getting her attention and release her back .. so we can decrease her attention on fence and direct it more to me. Needs lots of practice still ..,,,,,
Thanks for sharing. Interestingly,,,,,
Lucy chases any reflection of light and shadows. If she hears me open foil or turn on the sink she runs into the kitchen with a toy in her mouth and bites and shakes the toy or drops and pounces on the toy,,,,,
I wonder if it has to do with her deafness. They say that when one sense is taken away one or more is enhanced. It's like her sight is seeing things not there,,,,,
I actually know a dog with something like this. He's an Aussie,,,,,
How did you figure out that this wasn't just your typical crazy border collie antics? This is very interesting to me having grown up with them and planning to have them in my life forever.,,,,,
I have never seen this before and would not know it if you had not explained.   As you said,,,,,
May I share this?,,,,,
Thank you for posting this Aki. Maybe this will help other's who may be dealing with the same type of problems. I just want to give both of you a hug. There is a reason you and BB found each other. Praying for you all and hugs to Coop too!❤️,,,,,
It looks like she's chasing her shadow to me.,,,,,
So very hard to see her frustration at such a young age.  I am hoping with your training,,,,,
So sad for her,,,,,
I see that you have him on medications,,,,,
Poor girl.,,,,,
We had a lab who had this.  It was utterly heartbreaking.,,,,,
Thank you for sharing! I know everyone feels so grateful to know she has you to help her. One can only hope that she improves as a result of your wonderful care. 🐶❤️,,,,,
How frustrating and bless you and your family for helping BB!,,,,,
I'm so glad you're her Mom. 💓💓💓💓,,,,,
I'm so sorry..it's such a frustration for her. I guess you are right- humans have OCD and so do some other species. LIke someone else said - I'm so glad you are her mom :),,,,,
Has anyone ever used a laser light with her?  I have a BC that someone used a laser with.  We are still working on the damage that was done. He does like her but will stop when asked too.  It is heartbreaking.,,,,,
My niece's deaf dog has OCD too with tiny things that flicker in the light or sunshine. And with light reflections from shiny items or flashlight. There's a spot under my desk that's dark but she sees something in there and barks,,,,,
Thank you for sharing,,,,,
This is so sad to watch... I had to treat a 8 monthes old Shar Pei who was OCD... it is really difficult to know wheither it is neurologic or comportemental disorders... I know you will do all that is possible for BB,,,,,
Omg. I just played this again and Sophie came running. So concerned when she heard the squeal.,,,,,
Thanks for posting that,,,,,
How about a vibrating vest for her?,,,,,
I'm so impressed with how you're working with her Aki...(says this OT who spent a good amount of years working with kids with sensory processing disorders.)  I've not actively used my skills with dogs who have similar issues as the kids I worked with,,,,,
What about one of those sliding/rocking benches that you can put on your porch?,,,,,
I hope you guys can figure out a way to help her and keep her. I am absolutely certain you will do everything in your power and more to make it work.   What is the situation with the kids right now? How does she react? Or are you still keeping them separate?,,,,,
Aren't there vibrating chairs that one can buy for babies? Look similar to the swing in the video,,,,,
Vibration in the car is the one thing that keeps my son (has sensory issues) calm. When we stop,,,,,
She is so sweet.  And so little.  I wish Mimi could relax in the car.  She sits up in back seat like she is telling me how to drive.  But at least we are over the car sickness for short trips.,,,,,
So cute!!!  I volunteer to push!😘,,,,,
You are on to something here!!,,,,,
Maybe a baby swing can work?,,,,,
I would love to swing with her!!!,,,,,
Wow! You're so smart.,,,,,
So sweet!,,,,,
Push me mom!,,,,,
Adorable!!!,,,,,
lol. what?,,,,,
Omg! Very cool!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,,,,,
Awesome!!💙🐺🐾🐾,,,,,
"""Cherry toomatooo""",,,,,
👏👏👏tv star already!!,,,,,
Awesome!!!!,,,,,
I love the bloopers!  I get the same from Jet and Verse...accidentally reward a behavior...It makes me laugh and laugh...  Makes the training sessions so much more rewarding to me when it happens!  :-),,,,,
I have to admit I laughed out loud watching both with the accidentally rewarded behavior!   Love love love.,,,,,
Also note that they're working with among the smartest dog breeds on the planet.,,,,,
Adorable. I've never seen hand flashing? Is that commonly used to train deaf dogs?,,,,,
Love and miss her still everyday,,,,,
Awww!  Love these clips of Jazzy and now BB!😘😘😘😘,,,,,
The bloopers are my fav 😍,,,,,
Robyn Pepin the girls know this right?,,,,,
Very nice! I love that you included the bloopers :),,,,,
Ha! The bloopers ❤❤,,,,,

I got the chills!!! You had a visitor !!!❤️👌🏻,,,,,
This is so cute! I haven't been feeling well and so this really brings a smile. Love it!   I hope when I feel better that I can teach my Daki to do these things.  Thank you so much!,,,,,
I got goosebumps! ❤️ Someone is there with you!,,,,,

Awesome! Love the bloopers. I need to teach my Kaito to hold and catch...  when I first tried to teach him to catch (thinking he'd do it naturally) he literally gave me a look of 'why are you throwing treats at my head?!'  😀,,,,,
Great teachers make great students! Great job Aki and BB!!! 👏🏼👏🏼😍😘👍🏻🐶,,,,,
Love to see BB progress.  You are an awesome trainer!  Love you both!,,,,,

I am just so amazed! You are such a good trainer. BB has just thrived and looks so darn happy!,,,,,
I just saw this on Instagram. You are an amazing trainer!!,,,,,
That was so precious Aki,,,,,
Love the wink at the end!,,,,,
Being adorable is so exhausting. 💕,,,,,
You two are so amazing.,,,,,
Well done,,,,,
Bravo 😁,,,,,

Impressive! I knew it was possible to get them to put away their toys. I just had not yet tried.,,,,,
Great job! You both rock!❤️,,,,,
You are amazing! Yes I did see the feather!  It is Jazzy saying hello and you got this!,,,,,
You're amazing!,,,,,
You two are awesome!  Can watch this all day!,,,,,
The little feather is Jazzy's spirit 😍😍😍,,,,,
Love it!  And totally agree,,,,,

What a great trainer! Haha the bloopers! 😂😂😂,,,,,
LOVE watching this! You are so gifted :),,,,,
Sweet Coopie!  He'd had enough and wanted to go eat!!! LOL!,,,,,

The bloopers are the icing on the cake.,,,,,
Love it,,,,,
What a joy to watch!,,,,,
I love Coop🐾🐾❤️,,,,,
So cute! Love watching these videos,,,,,
So great to see Coopie!!! ❤❤❤,,,,,
Dang she's getting big!,,,,,
Cooper blooper = sooper dooper!,,,,,
Cooper!  <3 <3 <3,,,,,
Edgar,,,,,
Ori stalks the geese and then sprints after them. When they fly off into the water he stands at the edge and puffs up his chest jumping up and down growling like he is the king of his land. So funny.,,,,,
Classic BC foot tuck. Nice job BB! 💕,,,,,
I love how you put music with your videos. What a great trainer BB has.,,,,,
Or a cat thing. Haha!,,,,,
Love BB,,,,,
Me too!!!! 😍😍😍😍,,,,,

So cute BB 😍! Camilla loooves broccoli 😄,,,,,
I feel the same way about broccoli,,,,,
Talk about playing with your food! 😄,,,,,
She is so darn precious!,,,,,
Aki,,,,,
The blooper is what most of my training looks like 😝,,,,,
This is awesome! You have done such a great job with her,,,,,
Wow she is doing great!  I want to try Mimi off the leash again but it only worked with frizbees in the past.,,,,,
Never heard of a dog with OCD! You are amazing for being up for this challenge. 💕,,,,,
Love it! Even just the basics are a joy yo,,,,,
Love it! Good job to both of you. The blooper is hilarious.,,,,,
I wish I could choose both the love and laugh button!,,,,,
What a wonderful trainer she has.  Great progress! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 love the blooper 😜,,,,,
How cool!  I love what you have accomplished with her!,,,,,
Love the blooper ❤,,,,,
Blooper is hilarious,,,,,
Hi Aki I am so looking forward to watching BB grow up.  I know nothing about deafness in dogs so I am looking forward to watching how you train her. I would love to know more about BB's temperament and how being deaf affects her day to day life other than not being able to hear eg:  is her bark louder than normal?  Thank you for sharing your love with us.,,,,,
"Oh my gosh! I love her so.  Look at the ""pretty please"" paw!  Mimi will do that.  It's interesting how you taught Mimi eye contact and she uses it on me when I'm not paying attention to her.  You are the best trainer!",,,,,
Good girl BB,,,,,
She's smart!,,,,,
So cool Aki!! Love BB!,,,,,
AWESOME!!!,,,,,
You are such a fabulous trainer!,,,,,
Amazing trainer!  Great job BB! 💕,,,,,
So is that third hand movement that I cannot quite specify (after the pointing and the laying directions),,,,,
Love this!!!!!,,,,,
Your doing a great job with her Aki!,,,,,
Good Girl!!,,,,,
Wow this is brilliant,,,,,
This is so cool! Would you ever consider doing a series of how you are training BB,,,,,
You are remarkable!,,,,,
You are amazing. Can you help an older dog that is going blind.,,,,,
You are great! 💓💓💓,,,,,
Love seeing this 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,,,,,
That's great! I dusted mine off last week and it is back up and running with fresh batteries.,,,,,
Jim Kilgos  This is the deaf BC in training I was telling you about.  :),,,,,
Yay! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😍 .. what is the handsignal you do after touch?,,,,,
Fantabulous! 🐾👍🐾🙆,,,,,
doing good!,,,,,
Fabulous!,,,,,
Awesome👍🏼,,,,,
If yours breaks I have one too! 😉,,,,,
Fantastic!,,,,,
This card game is great and my friends like the game 😀 Hoping if there would be more new expansion cards to add in the game,,,,,
You can add a partition to the main box that is size of cards. That way no sliding around cards and keeps them from getting damaged,,,,,
45 pounds?! 😂,,,,,

I love this short tribute to the Monterey Jazz Festival. And it was my pleasure to be included. I'm the guy in the Panama hat. This clip concentrates on 60 years of this musical event. I plan to be there for the 61st. Hope to see you there. Ernie Beyl.,,,,,
MJF is a magical experience. It's not just the music and the artists. It's the history of the festival and of the fairgrounds. It's the people that gather to hear and experience the jazz. It's the love you feel in the fairgrounds. It's the perfect beautiful nights. It all blends together for this wonderful magical experience. The only downside is when you leave the fairgrounds on Sunday night...you start longing for it to be September again :) ❤️,,,,,
Gary Fegyo Elle Scurich Richard Cooper,,,,,
Wonderful. Loved Go!! Jake.,,,,,
I love what MJF gives to our youth!🙏🏽🎶❤️. Well done. Well done!👌🏽🎼,,,,,

I just make it. There's a thing on Amazon I bought and it's awesome and maybe $15? You just use regular coffee grounds.,,,,,
You know how in Harry Potter and Azkaban they have the whole scene with the Boggarts and Neville ends up making it Snape in a dress?,,,,,

I have a tiny Windsor and Newton travel set but it's only 10 colours I think full pan. I ended up buying individual pans for colours I wanted but I might buy this.,,,,,
"Andy confused me by playing someone playing Lindsey STirling music on Guitar. It's like ""I know this...but I don't know this...""",,,,,
I wish I could draw,,,,,
Hi Jenny,,,,,
Hi Sarah,,,,,
This is Erutan isn't it? Because this is on my Halloween playlist on Spotify,,,,,
Yeah they're a bit cheaper on Amazon...where I have gift vouchers for.,,,,,
Also I never remember to clean my brushes after using acrylics so... XD there's that.,,,,,
Amazon informs me they are half pan XD it's just the size of the individual colour blocks.,,,,,
I love that set. Where from? my watercolour pan set is tiny.,,,,,
Are you following a plan Scar,,,,,
I only have knowledge from this because I started learning to draw like this but gave up after like 5 minutes.,,,,,
I need to vanish and do boring things for a bit. I shall return shortly.,,,,,
Trying to lose weight so unfortunately Bananas are going to be a frequent part of my being,,,,,

Shrek: Ogres are like onions. Donkey: They stink? Shrek: Yes. No. Donkey: Oh,,,,,
But I think the whole thing has a five second delay,,,,,
I love your drawing style,,,,,
It was an hour long so I think I'll finish it there since the inking is basically finished now anyway!,,,,,
Thanks everyone for watching,,,,,
Facebook just cut off the video,,,,,
Oops! The connection just died,,,,,
Do you use your sketch as a guide or as a rule - e.g do you change lines when inking or not?,,,,,
I get what u mean. That's great advice to go with and work with the direction of the drawing rather than fight it,,,,,
Can you talk through your process when you make some art like this?,,,,,
Y u so awesome,,,,,
No cause no,,,,,
This is really cool,,,,,
What are you drawing?,,,,,
Drgun so big,,,,,
Ooooh tea delivery dragon with dragon breath reheat at ur door. Sounds awesome,,,,,
Thanks,,,,,
That's the downside to sketchbooks...but they're also fab.,,,,,
Can u do all the fancy teas? With flowers n stuff in it :3 I want a really flowery illustration of this now I can imagine it already,,,,,
What's this dragons favourite body part or colour? And what does he she hoard? :p,,,,,
Do you usually get a sense of the personality of the subject as you draw?,,,,,
I'm enjoying being distracted from my tidying up!,,,,,
I want tea now too :(,,,,,
So which bits of the drawing is ur favourite to do?,,,,,
do you do this in particular areas or just intuitively ?,,,,,
Is that a Faber Castell pen?,,,,,
Maybe u should twitch creative :),,,,,
What brand of paper do you use?,,,,,
How awesome is thaaaat!!,,,,,
...So I went back to the previous page and changed the notes so it wasn't becoming sunset but still day,,,,,
▷If its clear = Draw it clearly ▷If it is ambiguous but the Bible clarifies it elsewhere = Make it clear  ▷If it is ambiguous but good commentators agree= Strongly imply it  ▷If it is ambiguous and commentators divided= draw it as ambiguously as the text,,,,,
[ if you want to see the full discussion head over to the Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/wordforwordbiblecomiccommunity/  CONCLUSION: So! In the end it was too ambiguous. When i created the storyboard for this is I had Zacheus up the tree in the panel where they approach Jericho. And then he was in the scene with the Blind man. But as it is possible the events were the other way around (as it is in Luke) i felt that would be too much interpretation and not necessarily right,,,,,
has that book i sent you helped in the harmonization of the gospels?,,,,,
What difference does it make?  One writer remembers it happening on the way in,,,,,
Plus the inerrancy of scripture is an important thing to consider,,,,,
Interesting - don't feel I've much to chip in myself but I'll be watching avidly to seeing how this discussion pans out...,,,,,

Michael would love your interpretation! Fantastic Thomas!,,,,,
A genius plays another genius' song. 😬,,,,,
Your voice is magical Thomas💜😎🎵🌈,,,,,
Sweet!,,,,,
A songwriter absolutely needs an acoustic that he or she loves to play. It's a rule of some sort,,,,,
LOVE this man's voice.  Nicely done on a great song.,,,,,
I bought the Sigma J 45 in the same shop last week.,,,,,
I like everything you said in this post.  I would SO look forward to another collection of songs from MP...,,,,,
Bravo!,,,,,
The neck is a little wide but really beautiful. These fucking things sound and play so beautifully and they retail for next to nothing. I love the look of this one too. It's a plug in also but simple and discreet. My Taylor was clinical and cold from day one. I never liked the design or the feel. I bought that acoustic for live stuff predominantly but I never used it. So I wanted a guitar I'd enjoy playing at home and I've already played the Sigma for fun more than I ever did with the Taylor. I need to feel something back from an acoustic and I only ever have one so it's important it's right. This one is a beauty. 👍👍,,,,,
Which Taylor did you have?  I love my GS mini. The nicest guitar I had was a Turner,,,,,
God only knows what it was called?? A Trump 2016 by the personality off it!!,,,,,
I'm still favoring the Takamine F-360S I bought brand new in 1976. A Martin D-28 copy that kicks more ass with each successive year. Not that I can sing and play like Thomas Walsh...,,,,,
WOW!  Thanks for that,,,,,
Just brilliant! :-),,,,,
Ray f*cking Purchase! 😏,,,,,
We *LOVE* Toast here at Toonist HQ! 😄 x #YesICanHearYouClemFandango,,,,,

I try and watch this one. Long time no see Pugwash music live!,,,,,
Erik Wulf Steen Svendsen,,,,,
Excellent!,,,,,
Finally I've cracked the chords of this one. Never saw G played with ring finger on E string,,,,,
Thanks for the invite Thomas... Unfortunately,,,,,
Well I'm tuning in! Love it Thomas x,,,,,
"""'Allo there",,,,,

Camille Jayme ang cuuuteee nya oh,,,,,
let me see you 3d a hot wheels car and not like its a smooth printed toy and it would take hours. no i wouldn't print instead of buy.,,,,,
Hhhmmm I've been thinking of something to weight it down,,,,,
That print isn't going to make it...,,,,,
If I needed something solid,,,,,
I'd love to see the final product,,,,,
I tried sand,,,,,
Sounds like a cool idea but you may want to find a primer that would stick to both the PLA and the stone spray!!!,,,,,
Also you could print you mold with a plug built into the bottom and fill it up after printing,,,,,
I know if the bed isnt solid. It would change the height of the bed some.,,,,,
Good idea,,,,,
I used resin along time ago. Worked alright.,,,,,
Andrew: Very neat stuff! Congrats! :),,,,,
Nice! This is one of my own designs that has worked out rather well... https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2378188,,,,,
My wallet.  It's been sitting in my pocket for more than 2 years now. Just cracked a few weeks ago. I replaced it with a similar design that has my name and phone number on it.,,,,,
thingiverse link?,,,,,
Or the parts for my solar installation.,,,,,
This replacement part for a mushroom vent,,,,,
Or this gearbox for the throttle control on my boat,,,,,
Looks like it needs someone to design a Hopper for it,,,,,
One at a time it be easer to sort by hand,,,,,
Awesome.  How do we get our grubby little mits on one of these then? Also is it printing onto bread??,,,,,
I want one.,,,,,

Beautiful voice and nice cadence.,,,,,
Kenny A. Pinson,,,,,

Awesome. I love the cure. :),,,,,
William Chad,,,,,
Love the song choice. Everything sounds great. Nice to see a young one doing a Cure classic.,,,,,
VERY NICE   CANTA MUITO LINDA VOZ,,,,,
How is that tuned? Sounds a bit like a Uke but reminds me of a CBG which would use something like DAD,,,,,

So it's basically a cigar box guitar,,,,,
Amazing. Such a full sound and only 3 strings.,,,,,
I love the people hating on this dude as if they could play any better.,,,,,
Christopher Abeln thought you might like this,,,,,
I'll stick with my Stratocaster,,,,,
Ok- don't just play it - 'Splain it ! 'This is a 3 string nylon acoustic or electric (don't know) strumbly stick? Ukulele minus one string? 3 top strings of guitar????',,,,,
The tuning... GBE?,,,,,
Mike Hale these would be really cool to mess around with.,,,,,

Brian Delling,,,,,
I like that it only has three strings.  Way less confusing than a six string!,,,,,
An ideal first guitar has six strings lol,,,,,
Buy a Canadian dulcimer,,,,,
Ramon Carrillo,,,,,
no le veo lo útil si suena igual que una guitarra :v,,,,,
I think I'll have to buy one of these! ;-),,,,,
So... it's a 3-string ukulele.   I think it's funny how people create something that already exists and try to say it's something different. :P,,,,,
Natalie Reimer,,,,,
Steve Kennedy,,,,,
Sound great for a three string guitar,,,,,
that is NOT a guitar. It's a guitar shaped balalaika,,,,,
"Sounds just like a guitar that you could buy in the Walmart Toy section. If you want to try a 3 string then buy a good cigar box guitar for under $100. ""WeeklyHouse Guitars"" makes great ones.",,,,,
overpriced junk....,,,,,
Why would anyone in their right mind want to learn on a three string guitar?,,,,,
It's a strum stick that's already been made forever,,,,,
Jake Warren,,,,,
So you're suggesting a ukulele *doesn't* project a sweet,,,,,
sounds just like my uke...you don't just strum away on a uke...sigh.,,,,,

Hahaha...That deadpan stare of serious annoyance by @Phil Tippett is so classic! One for the books!! 😂,,,,,
I should do a montage with all the pauses we had to do during our interviews for The Frankenstein Complex  It's hilarious,,,,,

This is cool. That opening shot was reminiscent of ROTJ. The rest looked like the forrest moon of Endor being overrun by invasive species. Can't wait to see the whole thing.,,,,,

日本語が変だと思いますよ？ 「ともかく」は「もちろん」じゃないと、普通の樹脂は使えないっていうことになります。  他にも何箇所か。,,,,,
Phrozen 3D Printerさん、 リンク先に行けば分かるような、例えば「値段はいくら？」とか分かるような・・・他にもいくつかの愚問のような質問がコメント欄にちらほらとありました。 ちゃんと日本向けの取扱マニュアルを作ってる？  こういう人たちって他人任せだから、売れてもトラブルの元だよ。  光硬化タイプのUVレジンなどを主に使って造形するんでしょうが、それ以外を使って「材料が詰まった！」とか言ってくるタイプだから気をつけなきゃ。 日本人のカスタマーは手取り足取り教えなきゃダメという文化になってる。 日本の停滞ってこういう人たちのせい。　日本メーカーはこういう輩も念頭に置いてモノ作り＆マニュアル作りをしなくちゃいけない風土になってるからダメになる。  老婆心ながらご忠告までに。,,,,,
造形のジュエリーWAXになるレンジの価格も知りたいです！宜しくお願いします。 また、クラウドファンディングでお支払いが先に払いですが、大丈夫でしょうか？,,,,,
消費電力はどれくらいなのか…。ジュエリーの原型WAXが作れるレベルなら欲しいんだけど、電気代がだいぶかかりますかね？,,,,,
3Dクリエイターとして副業を始めたいので興味あります。これは赤外線硬化でしょうか？専用レジンは国内で手に入りますか？強度と精度について詳しく聞きたいので日本国内に代理店あれば教えて下さい。,,,,,

価格は、いくらなの？ 宣伝ばかりで、価格は？,,,,,
XY解像度はどの位ですか？ ジュエリー原型用の出力に使用出来る細かさなのか気になります。,,,,,
積層段差がほぼ無いように見えますが、仕上げしてるせいですかね？,,,,,
この方式で９０万円は安いですね。,,,,,
これはいいなあ。 売上次第で購入検討。,,,,,
買おっかなあ,,,,,
なるほど！ 紫外線で硬化させてますか！？,,,,,
プリントしてるいる時、かなり臭いのでは？,,,,,
ヲタクの次の目標は、フィギアではなく 自作フィギアなのか？？？,,,,,

Thank YOU for always keeping it real Creative Thursday by Marisa!  Funny how I have seen more than one artist either speaking about low sales or having a sale.  Sales slowed down for me and I took a look at my inventory and went back and forth about marking it down.  I had a mentor say to me to never lower my prices on my artwork.  oy!  What to do?  So this morning I sat with it.  How would it feel to sell my artwork for a lower price?  What kept coming to me was 50% off!  Yikes!  Drastic,,,,,
Stepping out of your comfort zone regularly! That's where the magic happens.,,,,,
Hi Marisa. Is this live? It’s glitchy but I’m here 👋💕🌷,,,,,
But I neeeeeeed you to tell me! PLEASE!!! ;),,,,,
Love those burtsts of inspiration!,,,,,
Hello just thinking about making more money as an artist,,,,,

hello,,,,,
It's a passage. A road. Things change in your life. It's when you just have to do it. No matter what. And it's a never ending journey!,,,,,
Art is a piece of the artist's soul,,,,,
Took an online painting class. Got divorced and moved to a house that had a dedicated space. That made all the difference!,,,,,
They were done in a phase. I grew out of the phase. Didn't like the painting anymore. Someone else loved it,,,,,
Yes this is a good conversation,,,,,
Have a beautifully creative weekend Marisa! Thank you for today's video. ☺,,,,,
Hey your oracle cards are in tiny luxembourg now!,,,,,

It was so amazing to see how people were drawn to you and the faces you've known from the past.,,,,,

When you needed a break... i know i have that gift of gab!,,,,,
I get why you're retiring from them now... and that's not a bad thing!,,,,,
"Thank you for having me in your booth!!! I hope I wasn't the cause for the ""head clearings""! 😂",,,,,
I have a gigantic email brewing after being with you all day Saturday!!!,,,,,
I have oracle cards. Really want to get yours!,,,,,
Glad I caught this today! Have a wonderful week! Are your lashes still on?? 😂☺,,,,,

This Kickstarter is ending on Sunday the 18th,,,,,
I would prefer tiles with magnetic connectors,,,,,
Man,,,,,
Not to sound negative,,,,,
I had an old set of these.  I think they were from Judges Guild.  Circa late 70s or early 80s.  I think I still have them in my storage shed somewhere.  Decades of use out of those things.  I glued them onto balsa wood.  They were pretty stable.,,,,,
Though really cool only problem I see is it being super easy to accidently move them.,,,,,
I would use these...but the various dungeon tile sets put out by WOTC are hard to beat,,,,,
Vidal Rosado Jr. Check this out,,,,,
I use a smilar method but with cardstock. This is the next upgrade for me.,,,,,
You can lock them together by using plastic wrap.,,,,,
I used to use jenga blocks,,,,,
Travis Faulks this would be helpful in building caves lol,,,,,
Those are awsome man!,,,,,
Wish they were 1.25 or 1.5 for each square - the bases of the minis extrude beyond the boundaries.,,,,,
Cool and interesting.,,,,,
David Daniel these are cool,,,,,
Will there be tiles with 5' corridors?,,,,,

Ok. Seriously. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I ASKED YOU IF YOU WANTED ME TO PLAY BASS WITH YOU...ahem.   Sorry. I was in my underwear when I said that and...we’ve had 3 Nor’easters in a row up here... so that statement is how I got warm.   Until I get in bed & think about Curtis. Mmm...Curtis...BASS PLAYER! BASS PLAYER! BASS PLAYER!! Oh wait that was a dream. It was a punk band we never played in...someone shouted “1,,,,,
You're a class act Curtis... love you're stuff to bits dude...,,,,,
I don't think there's any other band I'd like to see more on Tiny Desk 💙💙💙,,,,,

We are also almost out of the Donald tearump and Hillary clibtean. We will probably not print more of these. The new series is delayed due to the warehouse fire. But we have moved,,,,,
Will each cube include all your recent designs?,,,,,
I do not drink tea!  I drink only diet Coke.  Do you make diet tea?,,,,,
Love this! I may have to help kickstart this!,,,,,

The best way to make grilled cheese is to take your buttered bread,,,,,
Who doesn't have any pans in their kitchen?,,,,,
Seriously? Why? It's NOT grilled cheese unless you ACTUALLY grill cheese! Just sayin' :-),,,,,
That is toast and cheese,,,,,
Another way is to wrap in aluminum foil and brown with an iron!,,,,,
Who has a toaster that can fit two pieces of bread in the same side? Not many,,,,,
The bags make grill marks?,,,,,
has anyone ever used these??  they seem too good to be true!,,,,,
No,,,,,
"I used to make ""grilled"" cheese in the toaster. Toast some bread",,,,,
Toasted cheese sandwiches,,,,,
No no No no No....  just no....  That is just wrong.  That I just wrong. Nooooooo,,,,,
I’ll continue to use my pan - I like my cheese 🧀 HOT ...,,,,,
Where is the butter?,,,,,
flip the toaster on it's side... no bag necessary.,,,,,
Waste of paper goods get a dam pan out people wonder why the environment is goin downhill cuz ur too lazy to cook !,,,,,
But what about the buttery deliciousness,,,,,
"That's ""toasted"" cheese. Not grilled",,,,,
What are the bags made of,,,,,
Oh,,,,,
I got 4 pkgs. at home. They do work. A word to the wise; press your bread a bit,,,,,
Grateful Dead lot grilled cheese for the win.,,,,,
Use a toaster oven and you don't need the bags.,,,,,
Who needs a bag? Lay your toaster on it's side. Butter it when it it pops out!,,,,,
Brittney I feel like you need this lol,,,,,

"My son Beau said it best ""They don't pay me for what I do",,,,,

Fair one! I know its a piss take,,,,,

I read that the troops were told to be there at 0330 tomorrow,,,,,

N Korea can barely afford their own parades let alone someone else's.,,,,,
I love how Schumer wanted a military parades just a few years ago but now he magically think it’s a terrible idea,,,,,
I love it. Awesome video. I am still laughing. Great job.,,,,,
"Legitimately had to look up the ""I went to France and they put on a big military parade for me"" quote to see if he actually said that.",,,,,

The incident happened a year ago or 7 years ago,,,,,
He was probably butt sniffing too but the victims were too afraid to speak out,,,,,
Probably make him an officer and white wash the whole thing,,,,,
Ross - even the beloved Marine Corps mascot isn’t safe from allegations of sexual harassment 😂,,,,,
I was there with you on numerous (all) occasions of the past year of his sexual rampage,,,,,
My dog must be a registered sex offender,,,,,
He was the first “equal opportunity” Marine. Don’t ask,,,,,
French poodle says #MeToo,,,,,
Taylor Holder can you believe this mess??,,,,,
And......I suspect he’s been doing it for years.,,,,,
Saw it with my own eyes on MCRD San Diego.,,,,,
So basically he was acting like a marine?,,,,,
If that's true,,,,,
Ross Henderson it's always the figures you admire the most who let you down,,,,,

I have a sneaking suspicion that the same SGM's are in the Army as were in when I was a soldier in the 70's.  It has to be the same guys,,,,,
Too soon for some of us,,,,,
It's funny but sad because it's true😢,,,,,
Snivel gear and sleep are over rated.,,,,,
Isn't this supposed to be satire?,,,,,
Ahhh,,,,,

I work at Popeyes on Camp Foster over here in Okinawa. I can fucking guarantee you that these marines are fine 😂😂 I’m a deliver driver and since the lockdown I’m constantly on the road delivering chicken. But this video has been something that I needed 😂😂,,,,,
Remember back in the mid 90s when all internet was dialup. In Okinawa,,,,,
"""Saved MREs for when things got real bad and we ran out of people to eat"" haha",,,,,
They ate the Airmen? Doubtful. We have computer training on this. Throw red crayons like a c-130 spits out flares and run like hell.,,,,,
Well that’s not so bad,,,,,
Nanu Orlando Ti Giorgio Rk Billy don't get trapped with me,,,,,
This happened once before when the barracks vending machines ran out of beer at 2am.,,,,,
How long before there's a Congressional investigation of the cannibalism?     I bet there's at least a statement in the Congressional Record in the next few days.,,,,,
Danya Kloser,,,,,
They're gonna have to eat something and fuck something. It was only a matter of time.,,,,,
I bet the Air Force would taste like steak on Christmas morning,,,,,
Felipe Santos 😂 MRE’s just in case they ran out of people to eat 😂😂😂 I’m dying 😂,,,,,
this just in confinement has been lifted just moments after the entire battalion reenlisted,,,,,
Joel Mitchell this is a pretty well known satire page for marines. This goes along with what we were talking about that night. Lol locked in the barracks with no alcohol lol,,,,,
Lane Christman you’re an idiot bro this is on duffel blog. It means it’s fake as fuck bro😂😂😂,,,,,
Good job guys.. Now we have to incorporate cannibalism into the safety briefs 😆,,,,,

Abbey idk why I decided to grab my phone and get on Facebook but goodnight lol,,,,,
And then he Vet-splains why back in his day they wouldn’t have allowed in so many liberals.,,,,,
"Every time I see a ""vet rant"" video I die a little inside.",,,,,
There has been a spike in bitter veteran “this is why the military screwed me over” or “this is what’s wrong with the military today/get off my lawn” videos recently and the description of the ranter is quite accurate here. What could this be related to?,,,,,
Let's see... I do have a pair of Oakley sunglasses,,,,,
Being a veterinarian myself I can attest to the validity of said argument about bob barker in this video.,,,,,
This was clearly directed at Graham Allen.,,,,,
What's with trying to ride the vet status to internet fame on social media?,,,,,
Lol damn duffel.  You've been doing awesome recently.  Love this one.,,,,,
You should just be executed for treason if you don't speak English.  That way,,,,,
Never heard of her,,,,,
This was much needed. Bless you.,,,,,
I will not propagate or increase views with a share.  It is all too real.,,,,,
This is amazing,,,,,

lol James Kentopp,,,,,
Looking at these comments it's a good thing Marines know how to take a dick,,,,,
If the Army says it was a gay bar,,,,,
Unamused,,,,,
Oh,,,,,
Asshats are jealous because WE are the only force listed in the constitution,,,,,
And just like that....  Duffeblog's HQ was found burned to the ground.  Lol,,,,,
Did you know the army lost their bases over and over again to the japanese during WW2. Also the Marines had to retrieve thus lost bases over and over again in hopes that the army would learn how to sustain a fob.,,,,,
I would like to meet the army pogue who came up with THIS idea.  While I freely admit I tried to join the army once but I kept passing all those tests.  It is the army who waits until the MARINES secure an area then they run in and claim victory.,,,,,
And we will draw a penis on anything that looks like it needs one. Especially port-a-potty walls. Ask Wagner.,,,,,
It might have been a gay bar after they signed up the real men for war.  Who knows what happened after they all shipped out.,,,,,
"So the big green weenie was literal back then.  Interesting.  Makes sense too. The phrases ""Nuts to butts""/""dicks to assholes"" and calling mouths ""cockholsters"" had to come from somewhere.",,,,,
Well as long as everyone was wearing their boot bands,,,,,
I use to say this to my young motived devil's but one was extra moto. Since I was a rank above he would reply,,,,,
Best duffel blog post I've ever seen. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Havent read the comments yet,,,,,
just because you are not one of the brotherhood,,,,,
"among the drawings of dicks were hastily scribbled down notes saying ""wagner loves cock"" it is thought that this wagner is a gay genie who if you gay hard enough each year",,,,,
Seriously,,,,,
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!   I don't give a fuck what anyone says,,,,,
Tom,,,,,
Hahaha this is great,,,,,
Paul Mayhugh Jesse WilliamsRussell Grant Wow this is sad.  Really sad.  Tremendously bad story.  Terrible where these Marines came from. Sad.,,,,,
Soldiers are experts on sipping sperm teanies and ass fucking. Look and the sperm chuckers coming out of West Point lately,,,,,
"Haha. That's a good one. Except it was too easy to tell it was fake because it started out with ""the army found.."" They were in route to Pud Tavern and made a wrong turn.",,,,,
And everyone knows there is only one reason to go into a gay bar... and that is to start a war!  To start a nuclear war!,,,,,
Mark Meagher Shawn Willis Steven Claiborne Pablo Gomez Mikaela Padilla Kelsie Marie Justin Hayward Bionca Latara Jermaine Bruce Karol Stolarski Sean Casanova Tyler Stoney Ahem,,,,,

Ladies and Gentlemen,,,,,
Go Ruiz this you lol,,,,,
Shame on everybody who didn't tag me along the 80000000 other vets in your vet's day post.  That includes you,,,,,
I do this shit every day.,,,,,
This is disrespectful.,,,,,

"Kameron Tippey this looks like your day tomorrow....make sure you tag me on your angry rant so I can ""like"" it. Yeah",,,,,
Ha,,,,,
Who is that handsome young whipper snapper!??,,,,,
Wait a damn minute....where can I get a free drink?,,,,,
Stop calling Jack great. You’re going to give him a big head!,,,,,

Taylor — coming to our household 2019! 😂,,,,,
Greene - you’d better be getting on this early!,,,,,
Macy Sills this guy gets it!,,,,,
Is it anything like the lobster I get at the Air Force DFAC? Seriously,,,,,
But it still has some specs of corn in it,,,,,
Hahahaha,,,,,
I tried a lot of the German menus,,,,,
Bring back the cigarettes.,,,,,
They included a bag to recycle the food for another meal,,,,,
The new flavor,,,,,
I’m surprised bag of shit won over bag of dicks,,,,,
The bag of actual shit MRE already exists it's just cleverly named 'beef with mushrooms'.,,,,,
"I thought we already had this flavor when it was called ""Chicken Chow Mein"".",,,,,
Micah,,,,,
Has anybody come in here on this page ever actually been on deployment and been hungry no dfac no MREs local food,,,,,
whats the longest anyone here has lived solely off of MRE's?,,,,,
The bag of shit probably tastes better,,,,,
"""No one from the navy or airforce know what an MRE is"" 😂😂 how ignorant",,,,,
Rafa Murillo Enrico Cota James Bartley fuck free meals on Veterans Day hook me up with a box of these bad boys,,,,,
Probably still taste better than the veggie omelette,,,,,
Really?? Compared to what a lot of us have already had. They want to treat us like Royalty with these new Gourmet MRE's.,,,,,
I see they improved the flavor,,,,,
Halal? How do you make a halal MRE? Praise Allah that you got food to begin with?,,,,,
Also included : hot pepper sauce and a mini exlax bar..,,,,,
John,,,,,
As spoiled as these people are this is a great idea! It's about time,,,,,
Phillip Fluke I️ love how the army is always trying to boost our morale!,,,,,
The omelet comes to mind,,,,,
Let’s not forget troops dying from sadness from kneeling athletes,,,,,
If y'all believe this America is one of the stupidist and most gullible nations in the world,,,,,
She should've shared that prayer for this poor soul.,,,,,
You don't share = you hate the troops,,,,,
Don't let this story distract you from the fact that if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with mesothelioma,,,,,
If you are not from Murica you are a terrorist my friend. Oh wait im from mexico does that mean???😱😱😱😱,,,,,
Whew!  I'm just outside that 200 mile mark.  Rip n peas,,,,,
Funniest shit ive seen in a long time haha,,,,,
Ben Pardee this seems like something you'd appreciate,,,,,
RIP sending thoughts and prayers to the families and the soldiers they knew 🙏🙏🙏👼👼,,,,,
Diana Cassara. It was only a matter of time.,,,,,
In veterans month no less!,,,,,
Rebecca Ellison Fisher “send prayers no questions” apparently didn’t work for them... so unfortunate ... 😑,,,,,
I can’t believe it. V v sad.,,,,,
1 like = 1 amen,,,,,
F,,,,,
Good!,,,,,
Wow brutal Ron Alphius,,,,,
Velvet: I had to.,,,,,
Kyle Edwards this why you should always share and post your thoughts and prayers.,,,,,
Loren Glenn Knott,,,,,
Bruce Hackensmith.  This is humor.,,,,,
Well that’s it I guess I’m boycotting Madden,,,,,
Veteran Nate Boyer came up with the “take a knee” idea.  Yet this comments section is still blowing up with people who don’t understand the protests OR satire.,,,,,
won't buy or play this dumb ass game,,,,,
Boycott nfl and all their sponsors!   End all subsidies to nfl NOW!,,,,,
Duff are going to trigger some keyboard warriors w/ this one,,,,,
Reading these comments reminds me of how funny it was when duffel blog wrote the article about the 82nd Airborne losing their airborne status. Haha people lost their minds. Nobody knows how to spot purely satire or completely fake news anymore. Everyday I’m amazed at people I know that share a blatantly fake article from an obviously fake news site and they don’t even bother to question it.,,,,,
WIll there be mini games for the audience? Like,,,,,
I wonder why it doesn't allow the offensive line to step aside and let the QB get drilled because he chose not to participate in a meaningless gesture...,,,,,
What's funny is DB probably beat them to the punch. I could see creative at EA seriously considering this lol.,,,,,
Lmaooooo first glance I was like whatttttt that's crazy!!! 😂😂😂😂,,,,,
The best part of satire are the people who dont understand it,,,,,
"it's definitely got to be a ""tap X repeatedly to kneel"" bc if you don't your guy just looks at his other teammates and pretends like he had an itch or something",,,,,
I can finally play like an actual NFL player. Thanks Duffel Blog!,,,,,
"Saw it and was pissed at first. And in the middle of my eyeroll I see ""duffleblog""... well played db. Well played.",,,,,
Wow what a time to be alive. The level of details in video games nowadays are just incredible!,,,,,
Hopefully,,,,,
I’m sorry Indignant because I disagree with your view,,,,,
We're giving football players way to much credit. We shouldn't worry about what they think about society. Anybody that does is a fool. I played football. Football players think mostly about getting laid,,,,,
Wow people still #TRIGGERED when they still don't know what the protest is about? 😂😂😂,,,,,
You can throw a balloon made of pig skin and that means I should value your political opinion? Sorry,,,,,
Do people truly believe that this is an option.  They don’t know the duffle blog is satire?,,,,,
So in depth. Those guys at EA put in all the details! Job well done programming nerds...er I mean heroes.,,,,,
If you tap the home button during the game it activates “dog fighting mode” which is pretty cool huh? Lol,,,,,
Does it allow them to beat their wives / girlfriends as well?,,,,,
Barry Sonenshein - your favorite part of the whole game! Just think,,,,,
Can we all agree that they're both annoying?,,,,,
Bowe Bergdahl can officiate.,,,,,
I'll hold his jacket.,,,,,
A poser,,,,,
Special Forces veteran Johnny Primo aka courses_of_action responds to Medal of Honor Dakotas  challenge to fight Dan ,,,,,
Dakota Meyer taught me that a regulation bowl cut is possible,,,,,
"Tbh both of them look like full blown retards for their ""feud""",,,,,
Will Dakota be allowed to borrow his balls from Bristol's purse?,,,,,
"Blizerian gave an eye-witness description of a young girl ""getting her head blown apart"" at the Mandalay Bay shooting & then declared ""im going home to get my gun & come back"" while RUNNING AWAY.  That girl did not deserve to be described in such an undignified way.  She was someone's daughter . . . maybe someone's sister",,,,,
Dammit DuffleBlog you're supposed to be satire not truth!,,,,,
Once the book bags drop it's on!,,,,,
Well there's a few minutes of my life I'll never get back,,,,,
I wanna know why Dan has Bristols phone number.......but end of day they are both assholes,,,,,
Real news!!!!!,,,,,
Kudos Duffel. That was clever.,,,,,
"Bilzerian is only 5'9""",,,,,
The playground is likely where Dan gets his dates,,,,,
You see this shit Angel Bravo,,,,,
#bilzerians,,,,,
Haha this just got weirder and weirder lol,,,,,
Someone is going to get hurt,,,,,
Omfg this was fucking awesome 😂😂😂,,,,,
This is pure gold! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,,,,,
Nice haha,,,,,
Women do this for your man get 10,,,,,
Does that even count as a deployment then?,,,,,
Steel lid time.  I remember the sotry of the army guy who spent three months in his barracks on a Southeast Asian deployment,,,,,
Same thing happened to me back in dubya dubya 2.,,,,,
This happens to women too.  My ex didn't bang anyone else but he sure as shit spent my deployment money on an apartment he wasn't authorized to have while we had a mortgage and the multitude of supplements he was taking...smh.  How do spend $10k on protein,,,,,
2 hours before landing,,,,,
Amanda Roland this better not be us! I expect to return home alone and broke!,,,,,
Came home from Iraq to find my ex-wife was banging anything with a dick and a pulse. Tiffany Griffith Alexopulos or whatever you go by these days,,,,,
Christian Flores Tyler Counts Colie Diane this is by the same people,,,,,
A new twist on survivor's guilt?,,,,,
Not like the Dependa who used the money to put a swimming pool in a married quarter.,,,,,
Joshua Staats Nathan Vetter haha duffel blog only has stories of fiction 😂,,,,,
That sucks man thank you for your service semper fi,,,,,
Alexa McElmoyl Such a sad story 😔,,,,,
Caroline Liebert take notes on what to do,,,,,
Bri Carrier when I deploy again.,,,,,
I think he rates a direct commission.,,,,,
Caroline Nadeau 7.5/10 good for a laugh,,,,,
Oh I miss the good old days!...,,,,,
I love you guys 😂,,,,,
Jay lmaooo,,,,,
Austin Sharp if you were still in 😂,,,,,
Stevie what a tragedy,,,,,
Tonia 😂 fake news,,,,,
Hahahhhhhaha Ron Alphius,,,,,
i never thought the day would come when young people actually believed that WWII veterans are privileged,,,,,
It's not a legitimate opinion unless Slim Shady freestyles it..... thank god he had the courage to come out against Trump. I only hope other celebrities will follow.,,,,,
Whats sad.. is this isn't out of the realm of possibility in America right now,,,,,
That awkward moment when you can't tell if duffle blog is a legit news source or still satire.,,,,,
Honestly,,,,,
Duffel Blog you son of a bitch! My IQ was ready to commit suicide after watching this,,,,,
Its our own damn fault we took history out of schools discipline out of everything and told these snowflakes their special all their lives.,,,,,
This is satire.,,,,,
Hopefully this is a sick joke. War veterans deserve eternal respect. Those slinging shit at them deserve to have their teeth kicked down their throat.,,,,,
Man,,,,,
The red lettering sucks donkey...,,,,,
It's sad when DB does a story that could actually be mistaken as legitimate,,,,,
The pussy liberal leftists are the plague of our civilization right now...these cunts need a wake-up call,,,,,
What kids today don’t realize is that if it wasn’t for the World War II veterans who fought and died that we would be under a Nazi flag,,,,,
DAMN YOU!!  I didn't see the logo right away - I thought this was real for a minute! ...You gotta come up with stuff that is more far-fetched.,,,,,
Please lord baby Jesus tell me this is a prank,,,,,
Im not sure but i think this might be fake 🤫    Also Moonbeam Cinnamon Smith-Mustafa-Rodriguez-Gluten is pretty cute and should DM me on facebook,,,,,
When I saw it was coming out of Berkeley,,,,,
In today's society it wouldn't surprise me if this was a real story,,,,,
Having spent 6 years in Berkeley,,,,,
At first I saw the headline and thought,,,,,
This would be a lot funnier without the red type. I lost some of the joke trying to make out the words.,,,,,
C'mon folks,,,,,
Hey,,,,,
Ryan micro-ag your heart away,,,,,
I don't know who's the bigger idiot,,,,,
Stop. Liberal morons believe this stuff.,,,,,
Quotes without references nor videos as evidence... FAKE NEWS...,,,,,
Trump is going get rid of the state of New Mexico too!,,,,,
I hate when I'm reading an article or watching a video on this page and after about ten seconds I start thinking what kind of window licking mouthbreather would do some shit like that. Then I realize what page I'm on,,,,,
um..Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.  Is that why this is funny?,,,,,
Unfortunate that reality has become so bizarre I was willing to believe this was true before noticing the source.,,,,,
Is it sad if I'm not sure if this is satire or reality?...,,,,,
Don't give him any ideas,,,,,
Next thing you know Filipinos will have infiltrated the Navy.,,,,,
Never say Happy Cinco De Mayo to your Puerto Rican friends... trust me,,,,,
Sad to think that there are zillions of embiciles out there who will take this as legit news. Our military would collapse if the Boriquen troops say adios MF and head back to NY or la isla.,,,,,
When you're a full 30 seconds in before realizing it's Duffel Blog.,,,,,
This is the second time you bastards got me with this,,,,,
Hey guys,,,,,
This god damned thing got me twice. This is the most accurate parody since this one: http://www.theonion.com/article/bush-our-long-national-nightmare-of-peace-and-pros-464,,,,,
Sadly,,,,,
Daniel Scharnhorst ever since 1898 they been bypassing laws to become citizens lol 😂😂😂... i wonder how many liberals didnt know this was satire,,,,,
SCREAMING with laughter because I have been living in Latin America for the last 5 years and I am very aware of stereotypes....good job on this video Duffel Blog (y) Plus I was in the USMC with some guys from PR and one of my best friends is from there as well.,,,,,
The wall will keep them there.,,,,,
Eliseo-Leonie J A Perez go back to Mexico you piece of garlic....u smell like it too. Lol,,,,,
Jose Diaz lol PRicans send’em back over the border! And i pray the cowboys beat the redskins,,,,,
Robert Baulderstone I thought this one was real for a second,,,,,
Duffle Blog,,,,,
Odeymis Marie Marrill,,,,,
No,,,,,
"isn't ""heterosexual infantryman"" kind of an oxymoron?",,,,,
This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable in our military. How can we expect God to look on us with favor if this is permitted?,,,,,
There's a line between gay chicken and gay. It's a very blurry line,,,,,
Well yeah. Play it in the Navy and the next thing you know there's a gay orgy happening on the helo deck.,,,,,
Yea that's not ok. He sexually harassed how many of his fellow infantryman,,,,,
At the point,,,,,
I don't think everyone commenting they could beat him made it to the end of the video,,,,,
Lmao this has nothing to do with the LGBT.... gay chicken is one of the MANY dumb things we do on our own in the military,,,,,
The best part about this is the fact they went out of their way to give gay chicken an official definition,,,,,
I thought he raised gay chickens and had the most amount of them lolololol nope,,,,,
"Until you have sung ""It's a whole new world"" in open showers at ntc and wash Each other's backs.  Fuck off.  And that's BEFORE deployment.",,,,,
I challenge this hero.,,,,,
"""Heterosexual"" infantrymen. The Kinsey scale would have news for a lot of these individuals I'm sure. 😉",,,,,
I did this to my extremely homophobic nco. It got to the point where I would start messing with him first thing in the morning,,,,,
What are the boundaries? Actually having sex with a man goes well beyond the hula hoop of intimate contact. Unless he did not like it,,,,,
"Should we be impressed that a gay guy would win ""gay chicken"" against straight men?",,,,,
"I was like ""all they did was act gay with gay remarks and gay touches?? You know how many times I kissed a man playing this""  End of video  ""he is champ",,,,,
Its called being gay... Hes not a champion of acting gay,,,,,
Jake Swanson Robert Ward Justin Carlin Anthony J Holman Marty Brosett this story should be about Lopinto. I can still remember him getting in the shower with me and thinking it was perfectly ok.,,,,,
Think we need another sharp breif,,,,,
This dude has played a game of gay chicken longer than most people have even been in service,,,,,
Yeah this isn't a game to this gay,,,,,
Brandon Zellers,,,,,
Haha Codie Nicole Sky Clayton Nick Huss Yalindra Dolapihilla for those people that are confused about this game,,,,,
Elton John better be getting a royalty check from all this.,,,,,
If the bloody press would stop reporting all this,,,,,
Two egotistical assholes who wouldn't give it a second thought about killing thousands. How about you two ASSHOLES fight it out & keep the rest of us out of it. You corrupt sick fucks! But if you have to Kim! Drop a few bombs on a little ol place called Washington DC. There's a couple of white buildings there every American could do without.,,,,,
this will never stop being funny,,,,,
Hey,,,,,
he should be happy,,,,,
Set up a big PA  system in the DMZ and blast it!,,,,,
This actually happened to me... Except I got the lyrics for Daniel mixed up with Rocket Man,,,,,
She packed my bags last night,,,,,
Un later stated that by calling him Rocketman,,,,,
Should be a Tom Clancy esque book/movie called Operation Rocket Meme,,,,,
I can't believe it took so long for this to happen.  Well played,,,,,
Or all the bombs dropped on innocent “Civies” during the Pacific Theater...but that hasn’t been of any importance.,,,,,
Calling bullshit because the rocket man would never give credit for anything. Let alone give credit for a song to a filthy western pigdog.,,,,,
You guys kill me!!! ... 😂😂😂😂,,,,,
Had to look at the poster first again....,,,,,
And now it's stuck in my head!!!,,,,,
dude this shit looks real...,,,,,

an investigation has been launched,,,,,
But is he Vegan?,,,,,
And he's a cross fitter! He hasn't mentioned that either? WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!?,,,,,
I only had to watch the first ten seconds.,,,,,
Why wouldn't you tell people you vape? You have to tell people you vape.,,,,,

Would probably be more effective than his predecessors actions......,,,,,
Hadrian's Wall worked for centuries.,,,,,
Probably cheaper than the nonsense we continue to do.,,,,,
Don't give Trump any ideas.,,,,,
It took me a lot longer to realize this was satire/Duffel Blog than I am comfortable admitting.,,,,,
Stack dead bodies,,,,,
Finally,,,,,
If it was on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan... it would work..,,,,,
Brandon Tucker srsly gonna be so pissed if they get their Wall first,,,,,
Don't forget,,,,,
That just might work.,,,,,

One of Trump's promises!,,,,,

That damn Paul....  Deployment in Afghanistan is a right for all soldiers,,,,,
Next thing you know his whiny ass will want to audit the fed to find out where our money is going. The audacity of this guy.,,,,,
"He's all: ""but the Constitution says...blah",,,,,
Is this great satire or is this person who made this video really a moron,,,,,
Defense Contractors hate him!!,,,,,
The war in Afghanistan should have ended 10+ years ago. I stand with him.,,,,,
Next up: Trump to resurrect Osama bin Laden,,,,,
Sen Paul displays such insight and clear-eyed vision into foreign policy. Would it astound any hound here to know he's a licensed opthalmologist?,,,,,
I wonder how many idiots will actually share this before fact checking.,,,,,
Dammit,,,,,
I agree with Rand,,,,,
FUCK  duffle bag!!! You are fucking traitors to the Constitution and to the Republic! Iraq war vet OIF1 USMC! #randpaul2020,,,,,
This is satire...correct?,,,,,
I couldn't read have the text superimposed on the graphics,,,,,
Ah yes,,,,,
....but we arent finished liberating those wonderful people who love us to death! When we drop bombs on them they never forget to send thank you letters on sheep skin.,,,,,
Rand Paul is the man.  The GOP messed up big when they let him slide to the wayside.  He would've been so much better for our country.,,,,,
Defeatist snowflake!!!,,,,,
Duffle blog hacked?  Or did someone piss in ur cornflakes?,,,,,
Which was the *first* UNDECLARED war?,,,,,
Congress should have to vote for sustained military action used against another large force. The only exception I can think of is swift retaliation for a strike against us or an ally. The power to bomb the shit out of anyone anywhere without declaring war isn't cool though,,,,,
Well who else is going to be buying hellfire missiles except for us?,,,,,
If we are authorized to bomb the 9/11 terroist why hasn't the CIA bldg been bombed yet?,,,,,
The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be endless.,,,,,

I just hope I never have to see Camp Trumpleton,,,,,
Well you got to admit it is very odd to have a Fort Lee but not a Fort Grant.,,,,,
I am all for honoring president Trump but renaming a fort because it is offensive is fucking retarded the military is not about appealing to other people's feelings it is about destroying the enemy. the snowflakes need to get a fucking life,,,,,
Logan Doerfler,,,,,
NTC will be renamed to Ft. Trumperwin/National Trump Center,,,,,
Did my basic and AIT at Fort Trump In the Woods in the State of Trumpery.,,,,,
Change the name,,,,,
Where is Lee Harvey Oswald's grandson. I'll certainly donate my portion,,,,,
I went to basic at Fort Trump Wood,,,,,
It's gonna mean a lot of good things for a lot of good people,,,,,
I know this is satire. But changing one loser legacy into another loser legacy? If this were real,,,,,
The Adolf Hitler fort of friendship and tolerance.,,,,,
Just a joke but Bragg's horrible leadership gave the north time to get their act together and find a general with the guts to fight. He should only be memorialized in army manuals as what not to do..,,,,,
Oh yeah so bright to spend that kind of money fir a study when it could be put to use in,,,,,
bwaahaaaa........someone needs to put a warning label on this post or people will go bonkers,,,,,
I haven't laughed this hard in months :-D,,,,,
Call them what you want,,,,,
I certainly hope this is a joke,,,,,
The government is also renaming some National Forests as Forest Trump. Coast Guard in the Gulf of Mexico renamed a patrol vessel Bubba Trump..,,,,,
That will really piss off them liberal fools,,,,,
This is epic. Cannot wait for the hate. Even here people have to make stupid comments...if it were real....blah,,,,,
YOU WERE IN MY HOOD!,,,,,

Hilarious,,,,,
or Horrorlious,,,,,
Good lord we were awesome!  ha ha!  Are you finally finishing all of these scenes up?  Send me copies of all of them if you are.....what should we do next?  Since it will take another 10 years that gives us plenty of time to think about it,,,,,
I actually had a couple scenes and some graphics done a long time ago. This one even made it on the big screen at visions.  I'm cleaning up my house and came accross the tapes and thought I would upload them a couple good ones. What I really think we should do is start over. We got a couple good scenes but the bar scene was still weak. We're in the era of high def. Most of the material is still relevant but could be updated but I'm a lot further along as a filmmaker.,,,,,
Hey this is pretty good. The bride was great.,,,,,
Hi,,,,,
"I love when you shut him up with the ""shut it"" hand motion",,,,,
I'm up for an update!!!!  Hated parts of that bar scene.  Only a few good moments.  And yeah,,,,,
So let's talk. We've all come a long way and know better what we're doing.,,,,,
Sounds good!,,,,,

Hmm. Well you know how it is when you're making films in  the middle of the night...<g> Seriously,,,,,

Great idea. How can I get one of these cables? Do you ship worldwide?,,,,,
VOLTA is hands down the best product I have seen for this type of product. I personally started as a kickstarter backer. Through some ups and downs we finally got our product. Boy did these live up to their expectation. They charge fast,,,,,
This is by far the greatest charging cable I have encountered up until now and it is still functioning really good after months of extensive usage. Definitely worth to pick up more than one as I do feel one cable/tips is never going to be enough in this technology era where everyone have tonnes of devices with different charging requirement,,,,,
Ever since I saw the Volta Charger on Kickstarter,,,,,
Here’s a 10% off code for anyone interested http://voltacharger.refr.cc/meleney,,,,,
Completely sold out of 2m cables. When will they be in stock?,,,,,

Breath of the wild changed my life,,,,,
I try to play Gruff in the mornings,,,,,
I've been trying to play Dnd,,,,,
Like,,,,,
You guys need a Contraption named Hawking. In honor of his death.,,,,,
I am probably going to order a pack of microns on Amazon.,,,,,
Nothing to do with gruff,,,,,
Totally worth getting fired and living in your shed in indentured servitude,,,,,
He definitely needs a better name than a cheap batman reference,,,,,
I dont think your wife wants to live in a shed Robert.,,,,,
I like the contraption of the tiny gruff riding a tractor,,,,,
Current Gruff looks like he's got a gas mask,,,,,
I recently finished a Kefka Pop Vinyl.,,,,,
Does he have a tiny wheel for his front feet?,,,,,
Monster Hunter will never be PC I don't think.,,,,,
Hahaha Hardy was a joke cause of Bane,,,,,
I will forgive you,,,,,
Thinking toxic stuff in the vials,,,,,
That was terrible. Dont make jokes,,,,,
I DIDNT THINK THAT WAS AN OPTION,,,,,
His face looks like he got stuck in a pickle jar,,,,,
*aren't understanding the rules.,,,,,
This is perfect time for me anyway hehe,,,,,
Oh and Brent,,,,,
So when I break the bank in this campaign I can live in your basement and you can farm ideas from me for rent right,,,,,
Oh and when I move into the shed I need to learn the secrets of the Grendel breeding practices. I need a real life Rollin.,,,,,
I'll be honest...It took me a long time to like this gruff,,,,,
Shared the stream though,,,,,
aaah,,,,,
I'm having a hard time thinking of names for him!!,,,,,
I do love goats,,,,,
When I become your shed apprentice do I get to learn the forbidden breeding practices,,,,,
We binged all of phase two marvel movies,,,,,
Getting ready for work and sneaking around watching y'all again,,,,,
HOw about transformer goats,,,,,
I thought Skullclan until Michael said deepthing,,,,,
YOu have to play on our TOA campaign too,,,,,
Brent missed my post! You need a new moderator,,,,,
He's rage baked and didn't see it,,,,,
That's awesome that picked that phrase up!,,,,,
Haha my joke has been missed twice,,,,,
Y'all have just redirected my sleeplessness,,,,,
Haha it's funny,,,,,
because i have to get up so early,,,,,
So up my pledge by another $500? Hahaha,,,,,
Curdle is perfect I think,,,,,
Spread the word,,,,,
I would play that for sure,,,,,
Thanks for coming to the live art stream! Share this stream to be entered to win today's drawing!!,,,,,
You need car decals!,,,,,
I need this new one to be real and Skullclan,,,,,
Hopefully I don't have to leave,,,,,
Yay scarecrow! I'm glad y'all liked the idea,,,,,
Will we see pics of the stuffkin you were demo'ing?  Can't see the text well enough to see how the dream (draw) and nightmare (discard) interact?,,,,,
Its about collecting stray cats in your neighborhood before your neighbors. I will have to check out the cat burglar game,,,,,
Trying to decide if I'm going Dream team or the Dingy Dark (though discard doesn't go well in my play group),,,,,
I own the game,,,,,
if anything happesn to skipper i would kill every other shepard and then the trolls,,,,,
Have fun and great stuff.  I am off to home finally.   =),,,,,
Those are mighty big arms for a deepthing.,,,,,
I WILL CASH IN ALL MY POINTS FOR CURED GRINDER AND LEGENDARY GRISTLE,,,,,
Good golly miss molley its a GOOD GOAT,,,,,

NO LEAVE FLITTERMIND ALONE. What is wrong with you people.,,,,,
The giant zipper is nice touch,,,,,
I have obviously paid Robert to be my Grinder spokesman.,,,,,
I have a game called Here Kitty,,,,,
Darby is plotting revenge,,,,,
I am going to put WOE on my phone casw.,,,,,

Since its the dreamscape of the Betwixt,,,,,
I focused entirely on building weird and adding weird to damage,,,,,
I think she was using bukkit,,,,,
Thank you for drawing for us!,,,,,
He looks sort of like a toad.,,,,,
He digs Fluttermind's gworious tentacles,,,,,
Don't ruin my head canon,,,,,
Thats why Darby is missing.,,,,,
And you know,,,,,
You're already on my list.,,,,,
Don't rename my Gruffs Brent.,,,,,
Who was on your wife's team?,,,,,
They will be shipped TO YOU,,,,,
You can order them cheap on Amazon.,,,,,
His wings just haven't grown in yet.,,,,,
I WOULD LOVE A FLUTTERMIND SHEPARD/TROLL,,,,,
I can see the cards. No text though,,,,,
"So you are using the ""dream"" shepard with the nightmare goats?",,,,,
Blabbersac was a nightmare. 7 wins in 100 games ;_;,,,,,

"""We are the guardian of the caves of Old< The long forgotten",,,,,
Mutated Monster Goats could improve any situation. Stuck in traffic? Unleash some monster goats and bam,,,,,
I am going to edit the Gruff wiki,,,,,
Is he going to have conversations with Fluttermind?,,,,,
He is prepared for the hibernating times.,,,,,
His name wouldn't fit on a card.,,,,,
It means he is a gruff beefcake.,,,,,
I use a white eraser when I ink my work.,,,,,
I like the word,,,,,
Dang it. I had to check my timer on my phone and messed it up. Be right back.,,,,,
Graphite Pencil monkeys are the best.,,,,,
No,,,,,
I am excited to play it. I hope I can wins up getting a copy somehow.,,,,,
I request legendary Gristle for my goatmilk.,,,,,
Do you have anything on instagram?,,,,,
My cat has my arms pinned,,,,,
Sounds like a trading card game..,,,,,
Gosh i hope i win this goatmilk i love him too much,,,,,
need to get brent to sit for 5 minutes to tell me stuff XD,,,,,
This goat looks like one who would speak in rhyme and riddles,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,
I will love him and he will be named Skipper,,,,,
horribly mutated monster goats!,,,,,
So we share in the chat window? I came in on the last half of that sentence.,,,,,
I love this goat look AT HIS BIG HAPPY SMILE,,,,,
Ok,,,,,
"Im gonna call this guy ""Big Gulp""",,,,,

Def looks like a Bumbles to me,,,,,

😍😍😍😍 I love the original sketches.,,,,,
Yeah see and hear just fine!,,,,,
Congratulations you guys☆♡☆,,,,,

Thanks for the support everyone!! Please share the ks!,,,,,
Thank you sir!,,,,,
#dreamgoat #nightmaregoat,,,,,
#nightmaregoats,,,,,
yeeeeeeessssss,,,,,
Bless the Zumberg and his bones. Bless his coming and going that his passage may cleanse the universe.,,,,,
I've talked to many people who have used Thunderclap and rarely does it help - I'm also much more for sending people to your OWN mailing lists so you can market them in the future - not just launch.,,,,,
So by not supporting Gruff kickstarters we can end up killing the fictional world too? :O,,,,,
What you're doing now,,,,,
Thunderclap is a waste of time.,,,,,
Or you can just send them to me.,,,,,
I am afraid to make more Gruff pops. I'll kill em!,,,,,
I am not on twitter. I am on facebook and instagram!,,,,,
I wanna see the art for this Darby Discple,,,,,
I am rooting for team Nightmare as well.,,,,,
I want them to help the Grendals,,,,,
And now Gristle is dead and Darby is missing.,,,,,
Its nice to see other people use my hashtag,,,,,
>_> Which Grendal goat is that? That will be unlocked?,,,,,
I love the color scheme.,,,,,
It’s like xfiles,,,,,
Living room rug playmat stretch goal?,,,,,
Kill some Skullclan,,,,,
https://medium.com/hacked-tabletop/brent-crutchfield-8c51d54211cb,,,,,
I do. But Darby is also a favorite. I love ALL Grendals. And Darby has Flying Leap and is so small and grouchy..,,,,,
When I pitched the idea of demoing Gruff at Pair O Dice,,,,,
So the original set is getting a reprint? Does that mean some errata changes?,,,,,
Any chance the older goats will get an errata change to support the new faction symbol mechanic?,,,,,
Will previous promos be made available in this campaign,,,,,
BCW is about $100 to ship to Brazil (no local production) XD,,,,,
Try and catch them when they’re hangin out between rounds (the magic players),,,,,
Everyone at my local place won't stop with Magic to try the game out. :(,,,,,
It would be nice to see tabletop sim or tabletopia versions up.,,,,,
will branding be a thing going forwards or is it just for stuffkin?,,,,,
Totally down for Fluttermind as a shepherd,,,,,
Nice! Deepthings all the way. All Hail the Fluttermind!,,,,,
Sweet,,,,,
your campaigns are the ones i get most involved in. always excited about more gruff,,,,,
I'd love a giant box to hold everything!,,,,,
Righteous Obligation needs to become a card,,,,,
you mentioned new mechaniscs for factions,,,,,
We don't have those in Brazil :),,,,,
Ol' Darby is MISSING?!,,,,,
What have I ever done to you.,,,,,
tables are set for demos here,,,,,
Lets see how fast it funds!,,,,,
I am getting excited! YAY!,,,,,
I will THUNDERCLAP.,,,,,
Pledged,,,,,
A very fun game,,,,,
"""Only purchaseable via the kickstarters""...... only 15 day opening to purchase. nice",,,,,
We're in!,,,,,
Brandon John Dale Jay Gwaltney,,,,,
Heck yeah!  Get your stuffed Goats here!  Get 'em before the dogs do!,,,,,
#NightmareGoats,,,,,
hes better than Odin. rides an 8 legged gruff and has a bigger crook.,,,,,
i'm imagining he comes back as a Grendel Gruff God...,,,,,
*starts drawing legendary Gristle....,,,,,
yup with more horns.,,,,,
i want a brand...,,,,,
I need a naptime,,,,,
alot....,,,,,
you monster,,,,,
#nightmaregoats,,,,,
and skulls,,,,,
thank you! yeah show off that sexy box.,,,,,
Gonna be awesome!,,,,,
I am going to be demoing Gruff a lot at a new card shop in the area,,,,,
considering the kickstarters will have major impact in the storyline will we see more on the world? information about respite,,,,,
He needs a bigger HAMMER. Gristle has a hammer. He needs to ride Ultra Grinder,,,,,
The doggo is mourning Gristle.,,,,,
He showed brands on the Grendal Goats of the set.,,,,,
I want to see a sketch of Gristle as the Grendal Odin.,,,,,
I blame myself for Gristle. And I like the stuffkins so far.,,,,,
I can't make anymore Pops of these Sheparda,,,,,
Fluttermind demands that trolls have their own box. Away from the gruffs.,,,,,
That's a very cool idea. Help new players build a deck.,,,,,
are brands only stuff og nightmares or going forwards?,,,,,
will they influence mechanisms or just to build decks?,,,,,
Could you talk a little about brands?,,,,,
Blastov is the best! super under-rated and he would make a great pin/t-shirt!,,,,,
Yes the top tier does include original art!,,,,,
i will draw more goats,,,,,

But Grendal Goats are iconic.,,,,,
For some reason I can't see the live feed.,,,,,
Bukkit needs a handlebar moustache now,,,,,
I backed out and refreshed and it loaded,,,,,
Thats a lot of numbers.,,,,,
I like the sound of it too!,,,,,
Is that what we are? Gruffians?,,,,,

FUCK YES!!!!!!,,,,,
Hey guys,,,,,
Awesome work,,,,,
I've just made to the Gellian tunnell. Lo Peng is a lucky guy XD,,,,,
Are you thinking to add Spanish subtitles at some point?,,,,,
How much do I have to pay you guys to get this game now? XD,,,,,
on wich consoles will you port it ? No dates,,,,,
Congratulations I have been following the game development for a while now. I wasn't very confident with it earlier on,,,,,
Are you planning release at midnight between 22rd and 23rd?  I need to know when I have to get up or how soon I have to be home :-),,,,,
Guys,,,,,
"01:50 ""We had a lot of crazy ideas for the story. But as development time ran out",,,,,
I still can't believe you guys are going to be able to bring this game to the Xbox and PS4! Can't wait,,,,,
I'm still waiting to get my copy on Steam! :D,,,,,
Quit teasing us and release this game! 🙂,,,,,
When central characters like Thorn or Lo Pheng die,,,,,
SO looking forward to this.,,,,,
Can't wait =D,,,,,
I'm so excited to get the fruits of your team's labor in my hands. This is such a beautiful game and you can tell the team behind it had a passion for this game. Honestly think this could be one of the best games of 2018!,,,,,
Matt Ross,,,,,
Bryan Folan,,,,,
Wow,,,,,
This game looks awesome,,,,,
We feel a very,,,,,
Jarrod,,,,,
Jake Timpano just in case you missed this,,,,,

David Přibyl,,,,,

Looking forward to it,,,,,
Well....I'm hyped.,,,,,
Super good music here! This game is so beautiful with it's art and now some awesome music! I can NOT wait to get my hands on this!,,,,,
Just beautiful,,,,,
Fantastic stuff!,,,,,
Music perfectly conveys the mood seen!,,,,,
Wow! This is amazing!,,,,,
discord.me/ashofgods,,,,,
Amazing--pure amazement,,,,,
What sets this apart from Banner   Saga?,,,,,
Is it possible to view opponent skills and movement and attack and ranges ?,,,,,
Will be the stream be recorded? I need to go but I want too see it later,,,,,
When the game will be out?,,,,,
Wait... you guys are russian all along!?!?!?!?,,,,,
Wow it looks so much like Banner Saga - you guys have really captured that sort of style of animation,,,,,
these songs are amazing,,,,,
PRIVET RYEBETA,,,,,
Wow,,,,,
i'm spooked by the loading screen,,,,,
Change back to russian please,,,,,
you should lower the game audio a bit i think,,,,,
They had another stream recorded and posted to YouTube.,,,,,
loving the animations,,,,,
Than you,,,,,
The art is freaking impressive. Great work guys. Character and environment design are looking amazing.,,,,,
so hyped to play this lookin good,,,,,
That's how you star a game,,,,,
HOBAR NTPA,,,,,
Hello everybody,,,,,
Is there any sort of initiative queue? Or you Can use every character every turn?,,,,,
Can you mix differenti factions in multiplayer?,,,,,
Art team nailed everything so far,,,,,
Put the game on steam already!!!!,,,,,
this battle feels like battle chess,,,,,
Hello! Game looks good so far!,,,,,
Bene the knee simulator? ;),,,,,
When is early release?,,,,,
Seems like you have the same turn order problem like Banner Saga. That is that if you kill off the weaker units of the enemy player they get more turns with their powerful one.  Would be interesting if they all moved in rounds,,,,,
Thanks for the answers. I'm glad I checked the stream. Game is shaping up real good. GL every one,,,,,
Bend*,,,,,
Really looking forward to playing this!,,,,,
Cool cartoon.,,,,,
OH YES!!!,,,,,
I'm pretty sure you mean Kickstarter and not Lickstarter,,,,,

You guys got a kick-starter or something?,,,,,
Эмблема в финале ролика с названием проекта на черном фоне выглядит исключительно стильно и хорошо,,,,,
Mira Raúl Blackman como hacer una rotoscopia...,,,,,
My God. I can feel my hand cramping up. The amount of work you guys put into this. It's amazing. Gives me a whole new perspective on this art style in games.,,,,,
Game is designed by polish studio? :o,,,,,
Can i get this song anywhere?;D,,,,,
Sounds like an celtic cultural song.,,,,,
I'm feeling Witcher vibes!,,,,,
Ooooh,,,,,
Amazing music,,,,,
Just amazing...,,,,,
I actually got chills hearing that,,,,,
AMAZING!!!!,,,,,
Cannot wait for this game!!!,,,,,
As a composer/producer,,,,,
This is absolutely amazing. Can you tell us a bit more about the artist and the language? The singer is fluent in this language? How did she prepare for this? It's absolutely incredible.,,,,,
did she do any music in witcher 3?,,,,,
That's brilliant. Reminds me of some Cirque du solei show,,,,,
"If we're never going to see her why do we have to know how ""stunning"" she is?",,,,,
Im always forgetting to ask... On what platforms will the game be available? And why on earth not XboxOne?,,,,,
Are there going to be more frames in the final version? The animation doesn't look very smooth in the example is all. I know this isn't really indicative of the final product,,,,,
Very excited to see where your project ends up! I like what I've seen so far!,,,,,
This looks absolutely amazing!! Is there a Kickstarter for this?,,,,,
Ada Moskal marzę żeby robić takie 😲,,,,,
Well that was...something.,,,,,
Someone's on a roll,,,,,
Holy shit. You're stepping up your game. Props,,,,,
Keep it up. We can't wait for a game that shows standard of drawn animated games. Not many can do such work like that.,,,,,

Well done. I am always overwhelmed by amazing people that can draw like that. Keep it up.,,,,,
Beautiful!,,,,,
I really love watching this game develop.  You never get to see this part of the industry and I find it insightful. Also I would love to watch your artist speed paint!,,,,,
Looking good so far keep up the good work ill be first to buy it when it comes out at this pace,,,,,
I really like how this project is coming around,,,,,
This is looking really neat ! But aren't you afraid of being compared with The Banner Saga ? (frankly not a bad thing,,,,,
This looks absolutely amazing! Lekso can now feel confident about her skills--phenomenal!,,,,,
Oh this looks so great,,,,,

It has the same style as Banner Saga witch is GREAT! cant wait ^^,,,,,

'Whorish' is that a race ?,,,,,
Cool,,,,,
Wow! So they take the video and use it as a reference to the character they're animating for your game? That's amazing.,,,,,
Her archery form is awful. Why would you get a world renowned cosplayer for an animated game and not a world renowned archer?,,,,,
'whorish'?,,,,,
But why is she being so sensual about it? Make her badass and no nonsense,,,,,
Oh... it's 2016 and we're still hypersexualizing women... yay...,,,,,
"There ""exaggerated"" movements look ridiculous :/",,,,,
"Might want to reconsider ""Whorish Archer"" before it becomes a PR issue",,,,,
Have to agree with the above,,,,,
Ah btw. There where comments from guys mostly so far. I have some gamer female friends and they would go nuts seeing archer moving like that :D,,,,,

Scott Perry More like a campaign mode!  There are sealed decks inside that you play in order. Great for new players to learn the game. (Or you can just punch out everything).,,,,,
Feel free to join us on Discord and check out the tournament!  https://discord.gg/c7CDAj,,,,,
As you unlock them? What is this,,,,,
YES,,,,,
Large beast,,,,,
I hope he had it patented and copy righted. TSR stole a game from me and a friend of mines. The game failed but they still use a depth chart that we created for our game in Dungeons and Dragons.,,,,,
Everything looks amazing :),,,,,

به نظر من توهين كردن يا بد گفتن به دين يا مذهب دموكراسي نيست ، بلكه توهين است. آيا من اجازه دارم كه در فسبوك خود به شما توهين كنم چون كه آزادي است؟ هيچكس حضرت محمد ص را نديده ، پس چطور ميتواند رسامي كند؟اگر من يك نقاشي كنم و بگويم كه اين پدر مصطفي است در حاليكه من هيچ نديديم پدر شما را. آيا اين آزادي است؟ اين آزادي نيست كه من هر چي دلم خواست انجام بدهم.,,,,,

Maybe this is answer. There are better improvements with the DOF with the new one,,,,,
The lens are going to be available at the end of the campaign,,,,,
Para monturas Nikon puedes comprar el adaptador para lentes con cámara canon,,,,,

Olivier Rouquin,,,,,
How do I connect my mic at the same time as my monitor?,,,,,
I like the MoviePro app too... can't wait for that new anamorphic lens!,,,,,
Can the beastgrip mk2  control focal length?,,,,,
You can use Filmic remote on an old iPhone or iPod touch and mount it beside the lens on the front of the Beastgrip for vlogging.,,,,,
Have had good/mixed results with Filmic Pro. Have you tried Cinema 4k? Any thoughts? I have it,,,,,
Have tha app(IOS) can make the live photo?,,,,,
50 fps is posible?,,,,,
Didn't see MAVIS app mentioned ,,,,,

Is the mic on the desk with the computer? the key strokes are louder than him talking,,,,,

Hi jon!!!!,,,,,

No,,,,,
So where is the app that flip the image for camera? Not for filming,,,,,
I absolutely love my BGP I use for my iPhone 6s+ and can't wait to add to my rig. DOF adapter is the next on the list.,,,,,
Kickstarter is fail after fail. But beast grip is the best project ever. Their product is so bad ass. I love it,,,,,
Beastgrip is probably the ONLY Kickstarter is would trust.,,,,,
Does the DOF II allow the lens to auto focus?,,,,,
My rig setup for the iPhone 6s Plus. 😬😬😬😬,,,,,

Ping Chen,,,,,
Beastgrip track id,,,,,

I need this part for my job!,,,,,
Jeremy Vest Gary A Leland James Manning,,,,,
Would the image still be upside down if we used the new adaptor for Facebook Live? Or YouTube Live?,,,,,

You remember the one you did with the red albino rabbit eyes set close together?,,,,,
It doesn't look like a living creature with them so far apart.,,,,,
Yeah I think they should be closer together btw,,,,,
Looks dang awesome. Was it hard doing on the foam?,,,,,
On the drawing the eye in the middle is larger?,,,,,
But now Wyatt is showing Grey how to custom build a level,,,,,
You're tricking us with your drawrings.,,,,,
Oh I already kicked their little asses a few times,,,,,
That's what I'm thinking.,,,,,
The eyes are SO far apart,,,,,

William says you've always done that. ;),,,,,
freelance heart!  i work with lots of different places. this is one of my faves though,,,,,

Apologies for the terrible video,,,,,
It's not live anymore folks,,,,,
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1512506318/freyjas-wrath-dark-age-and-fantasy-28mm-shieldmaid,,,,,
The video weirdness makes it look like you're a Predator hand-feeding a raccoon,,,,,
About halfway/three quarters of the way through we'd love to have you do a blog post if you have time so hopefully that might help with a little bit of momentum :),,,,,
We need a childrens book,,,,,
Nice to see Little egg doing so well. Perhaps you could sell some of the frames of that video as modern art lol.,,,,,
It refreshes at random your voice is fine,,,,,
Pinning my meltdowning foster child and watching your feed morph into various shades of green,,,,,
Something is wrong,,,,,
How many units will you have in total? Can you list them?,,,,,
Not very clear picture its all pixelated for me at least,,,,,
awh what happened to beutiful annie,,,,,
is there a kickstarter preview up somewhere?,,,,,
I'm very excited to see to see them all and actually pick some up 😊 where's crusade?,,,,,
It was/is rather psychedelic,,,,,
Gunny Pets at Salute too :),,,,,
Just a bunch of pixels at mo,,,,,
I did,,,,,
How many miniatures are in the Bad Squiddo range now?,,,,,
Will we be able to buy other products from your ranges at the same time as the Kickstarter.,,,,,
Are there going to be anymore new kickstarters after this one?,,,,,
Meh,,,,,
My pigs are watching this too,,,,,
It sort of works for a bit and then goes pixellated again.,,,,,
Sorry wasn't listening too busy watching guinea pig 😍😍,,,,,
I have watched all of it. I love piggy's and your figures.,,,,,
My boys are patiently waiting for the gun-bunnies ;),,,,,
more shieldsmaidens!!!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!,,,,,
You do know that you need to be delayed a year to be a proper kickstarter?,,,,,
And what did it say on the Health and Safety course about using aerosols in a contained space...?,,,,,

When this goes live how do I view my account or log in?,,,,,
Will there be any way to get feedback on art through this program?,,,,,
Where can I find info on what this is and what the courses include,,,,,
It's not the 30th anymore,,,,,
Is there any order release courses?,,,,,
Can't wait,,,,,
Jenelle Hendey,,,,,
Talon Lihou,,,,,
Hi guys,,,,,
Here's a silly question: as an artist myself,,,,,
So orders in LA started shipping the 8th or the 3rd of August? is there any way I can track my order?,,,,,
Anybody in the LA area receive their books yet?,,,,,
I haven't gotten my book yet nor recieved an e-mail about it being shipped. I know I live closer to Chicago,,,,,
IM SO EXCITED TO GET THIS BOOK!!! ILL HAVE THE WHOLE SERIES AND ALL!!!,,,,,
I was just wondering. Which country will the books be shipped from?,,,,,
"is there some kind of confirmation mail when the books ship ?  or will the books ""just"" arrive ? ... because i havent got any mail or something",,,,,
Does the PDF version have all the pages this book does? I bought the PDF before the completion of the hard cover book and it seems not to have as many illustrations as the hardcover book in this video.  Also why is the video sideways?,,,,,
So I live in long Island and even though it says it ships out to new York on the 15 will I get a email  saying when it's coming,,,,,
How can we confirm that we filled out the survey? I'm pretty sure I did but would like to make sure.,,,,,
I live right outside Chicago so I actually got mine last weekend. I've gotta say,,,,,
I live in Singapore.I haven't got the books yet ..,,,,,
Any shipment in Texas soon?,,,,,
When will shipping to NY and PA take place?,,,,,
I think we are all in the same boat. On this post I was told the books are shipping now but I still haven't received an email saying anything about the book being on the way.,,,,,
I haven't gotten any confirmation of my books shipping and I can't track them for some reason.  I placed my order all the way back in May.,,,,,
Got mine today! Good book! The cover is a bit slippery despite the texture,,,,,
Sweet. I think this book will be my new travel companion when I travel with my iPad Pro.,,,,,
Yes! Can't wait!,,,,,
I bought the 1st and 2nd book in a bundle,,,,,
Mine should've shipped put of Chicago,,,,,
When do they ship to Virginia?,,,,,
When will they be shipping to Michigan?,,,,,
Its a bit annoying that half the video is showing 2 blank pages :D can't wait for the book to arrive.,,,,,
It may be foolish to rise up,,,,,
Guts from Berserk? He ain’t no good guy but he is just doing good things in the name of vengeance against the evil. He don’t care if it helps people as long as he kills the evil that killed his friends,,,,,
The tale of Beren from the Silmarillion is this in a nutshell and look what he achieved. #FirstRanger,,,,,
You gotta die somehow; might as well be while doing something legendary,,,,,
I was a footsoldier in the allied forces against the Dismembered Lord. We fought with everything we had but were losing ground daily,,,,,
I was 4 on that dark day... I was meant to be a peasant knight,,,,,
I was just a child then,,,,,
#Lightfall,,,,,
Nice!,,,,,
Can't wait,,,,,
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,
My niece thinks this is a video chat and is saying hi,,,,,
Tim.  Thank you and all you all do,,,,,
Thank you young master Tim,,,,,
Dat sweater,,,,,
Nice sweater!,,,,,
To you and yours good sir,,,,,
Taking bets now,,,,,
Cheers dude,,,,,
Hi from nebraska,,,,,
Happy Holidays Tim and all the rest of AbTab!!,,,,,
That is one of the best holiday sweaters I’ve ever seen,,,,,
Here’s to 2018!,,,,,
Thank you Tim. God Bless!,,,,,
Back at you Tim,,,,,
The beard!!!,,,,,
I missed the KS and have been wondering when this bad boy will hit the shelves!  I wants one I do!!!,,,,,
I can't wait to get my copy,,,,,
You guys should get you « imagination engineer » ring anytime soon.,,,,,
Watching my mailbox!,,,,,
If you're writing for a living,,,,,
If you commit to writing every single day,,,,,
Why do people do this driving? It seems so....unsafe. Is there something wrong with your living room?,,,,,
There is no such thing as writer block. There is no such thing as writer block. There is no such thing as writer block. lol,,,,,
Creativity for me is like building up endurance for running or anything else like that. The more I sit down and create,,,,,
"That's a good point too. I feel like many times what some people see as ""writer's block"" is more often hesitation that ideas aren't good enough.  If you come up with an idea",,,,,
Tim Kearney Idea Net Discord is up,,,,,
Yeah. I've been having writer's block for coming up with foils for some of my PC's backstory,,,,,
If you're telling other people about your writers block,,,,,
"Re: ""Idea Net"". I like starting with ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" as an end of story",,,,,
I'm in a bit of block myself. Great tips. This how I work through it too.,,,,,
I am a hoarder.  First step is admitting a problem,,,,,
Matt,,,,,
If you write for a living,,,,,
I wanted to discuss why sneak attacks don't happen for other classes. :(,,,,,
This is perfectly timed. I've been in a little bit of a slump the last couples of days. Appreciate it,,,,,
This post has already inspired me.  Motivation for my villian is coming into focus.,,,,,
My writers block is convincing myself to sit down and write. Lol,,,,,
Oh that's brilliant!  Copy and paste into an idea folder!,,,,,
I keep getting fish in my idea net... oceanic campaign,,,,,
Haven't seen one of these in a while.  Glad to see your face,,,,,
I'm not much of a writer,,,,,
Great advice! Can always count on AbTab to help out.,,,,,
Nothing creates momentum as good as momentum.,,,,,
we do the same thing at APoI,,,,,
Was any of it filmed amd going to be released?,,,,,
Hotels work well as they have a variety of meeting rooms that vary in size.,,,,,
I've already forgotten Matt is tall,,,,,
We went to half pint pizza. Definitely going back!,,,,,
i think i left my beard there,,,,,
ATCON Boston rep. Lol,,,,,
The ol' Long Con,,,,,
Thanks to your channel and the Provokers videos I'm super into rpgs and have taken my DM skills to the next level.,,,,,
I better start crafting for 2018,,,,,
The added benefit from a convention like ATCON is that most of the members know each other,,,,,
I've gotta say,,,,,
I work at Emerald Downs in Auburn,,,,,
Once you hit 200 attendees,,,,,
Can the ATCON Boston crew get some left over swag that we can get to the few people that showed?,,,,,
So many little moments over the whole weekend that really made it,,,,,
Brandish also gave out a ton of books! Not sure if you mentioned that part,,,,,
We talked about the con (As we fell asleep with our clothes on),,,,,
Sounds like everybody had a blast! Hopefully it's in the cards for me next year...,,,,,
My eyes were so droopy after the long day of the con,,,,,
I should pay closer attention this time around so I don't miss it this time next time around.,,,,,
Well you succeeded so hard there Matt,,,,,
Looking forward to the 2018 Con!,,,,,
Redhot and E9!,,,,,
LOL,,,,,
Mornin'!,,,,,
No one even looks up from their games lol,,,,,
Looks like a blast! I'd call this a super success,,,,,
The envy has been so real here!! So happy in behalf of those of you who are there! Have all the fun!,,,,,
Dangit,,,,,
Thanks for welcoming us in...had an awesome experience!  Can't wait till next year!,,,,,
Roll some dice for me! Happy gaming all!,,,,,
I don't know why I don't get sound on Live videos anymore... 😕,,,,,
when is the AbTab panel?,,,,,
Still waiting on that laptop time! :D,,,,,
Hiya!,,,,,
Yes I have its disturbing,,,,,
What's up everybody,,,,,
Have fun guys :D,,,,,
Looks awesome guys!,,,,,
Sup everyone!,,,,,
Keep'm coming!,,,,,
The NPC's God damn it?!?! WHERE ARE THE NPCS?!?!,,,,,
I woulda been early. Sad I was not quick enough to get a ticket. . .,,,,,
Who's playing the cleric?,,,,,
Why the name tags? ;-),,,,,
Does James work on cars?,,,,,
Hola fellow gamers,,,,,
Tim's shirt is the best!,,,,,
Going be doing this next year right? 😨,,,,,
My beard is a-quiver with anticipation..,,,,,
nice rats sraw T,,,,,
Woo hoo! Hype-a-roni and cheese!,,,,,
Awesome shirt!,,,,,
THANK YOU,,,,,
Oath of the Cryofrozen Sept Mother,,,,,
Imagine what the Harbinger kickstarter will bring in. Lol,,,,,
There is a second Barker who has just appeared next to me. This is literally happening.,,,,,
Flexible and open ended? Is this a Kickstarter or a grindr profile?,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,
Jerry Holkins,,,,,
I was stalking the page since 3 edt. Not sure how I missed this. Either way,,,,,
Barker just cloned himself,,,,,
I'm excited that you guys are kickstarting!  A great idea of loose content. Saw it from Drunkens & Dragons,,,,,
Would a stench goal possibly be  a short story about the oath of the frozen king by you,,,,,
Maybe a fun extra would be a harbinger spin on oath of the frozen king ? Although probably not since you are still working on playtesting the system.,,,,,
After reading the other books on the pdf bundle  This is the first time I've backed a kickstarter,,,,,
1. Your prior content as a company has been great  2. Trust you all individually as creators,,,,,
With this kind of content,,,,,
Also keep in mind that Kickstarter doesn't charge until it ends!,,,,,
Congrats AbTab! Awesome KS. So glad that it is already doing well ;),,,,,
Over 5 times the goal in the first 3 hours,,,,,
Maybe after release you guys could do some oath related tees 😉,,,,,
What movie coming out this year are you most excited about?,,,,,
Ryan,,,,,
Absolutely! Goodies are good,,,,,
I will be pledging friday. Just can't do it right now,,,,,
James,,,,,
Bro read the punchline first.,,,,,
I just increased the challenge ratings on all the things I've prepared. // Tim,,,,,
Dude,,,,,
Whasssup,,,,,
Hahaha,,,,,
Just watched Matt's thing with Nerdarchy and now this! Gettin immersed in Harbinger and loving it.,,,,,
Hello. Is everyone Harbinging on Harbinger?,,,,,
That's awesome because that feature of the necromancy school for wizards doesn't come into play often because they're wizards and the necro spell list is small.,,,,,
A contact theorizes the metal shield you found on the Harbinger can emanate a kinetic absorption field of sorts,,,,,
Maybe this guy was a warden on a Prison asteroid where the prisoners were made to mine. The flail was what he used as punishment,,,,,
Are shields like hunk of metal like dnd only or possibly some kind of plasma,,,,,
where can we join/start a play testing group? what's the best way to go about it if i'm 100% green to this whole Harbinger thing?,,,,,
electromagnetic firing is cool,,,,,
Tbh,,,,,
Does a Harbinger ghillie suit consist of 80% moon rocks? :D,,,,,
Hey all really excited to see the final because during my play test me and my group had a lot of fun.,,,,,
A cool flail would be a dead grenade(s) chained to a stick lol,,,,,
Any other characters that inspire you to make a Harbinger character you might play one day?,,,,,
He's also a criminal background,,,,,
Josh! Make sure you sign up for the playtest on the Facebook page,,,,,
"""Now I will flail my enemies",,,,,
I'm imagining a retinue of guards with large shields with shotgun murder holes in them.,,,,,
If something could change,,,,,
I'm hoping you have the opportunity to run out of bullets.,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,
I don't min max.But does anyone else find it hard to justify making both str and dex your highest scores in 5e,,,,,
You can essentially lose a weapon to it being worn down if you don't take care of it. It's a high level way to be able to find things and repair them,,,,,
Item conditions are also one more resource to tax on a character sheet to give something beyond hit points to tax,,,,,
William,,,,,
Think of item conditions as macro item hit points. // Tim,,,,,
// Tim,,,,,
Sweeet,,,,,
What's up! // Tim,,,,,
"Makes me wonder about a drunken master type caster who gets ""drunk"" on astra overload.  Lives on the edge of overuse all the time.",,,,,
So I'm allowing Human (Variant) for the game tonight,,,,,
I really like the idea of the colored Astra,,,,,
Can't wait to hear more about the Necrotech. It sounds so dope.,,,,,
So no Lloyd normal things don't get worn unless something special happens (rather than crits),,,,,
If necrotechs can manipulate / aid / harm the specters that would be dope.,,,,,
yeah. There are some astra effects that have armor that goes worn,,,,,
Honestly I think lots of specialisations works great from these three broad classes,,,,,
Also curious about the conditions,,,,,
For fade resistance do you get to do that every time you roll on the astra effects tables or do you only get to do that so many times per rest?,,,,,
Literally making one right along with you for tonight's game!,,,,,
Oh I was reading the wrong way! That answer was at the top,,,,,
I don't recall,,,,,
Still confused. Do all items become worn,,,,,
how many classes do you think will be in the final release,,,,,
Astra Fade has a Chuck Norris limit,,,,,
As of now,,,,,
Just download going to playtest Sunday!,,,,,
Sign up! http://absolutetabletop.com/harbinger-signup/,,,,,
(Nothing in THIS playtest,,,,,
Yeah I call it “boiled” because that’s about as ‘flavorless’ as I can imagine. = ) // Tim,,,,,
Martial artists wielding energy weapons is a little too “space opera” from what we’ve discussed. // Tim,,,,,
It’s 80’s Soviet Union Tech level.,,,,,
“Chater Rancher”,,,,,
If we're approved for playtest,,,,,
Will this be going up on YouTube?? I missed the stream and can't seem to watch it here.,,,,,
I'm still curious about the mechanics of everything. The changes seem pretty substantial- so what's left of 5e? Why not call this it's own system? I'm really interested in seeing the seams and what kinds of play these mechanics will encourage. (I still need to watch the previous videos that were released.),,,,,
My question,,,,,
What's the overall scope/vision for the Harbinger project? Seems like a lot to overhaul,,,,,
Do you see firearms being the go to weapons for person vs person encounters,,,,,
"I'm going to have a ""monster"" that is like a siren. They float around and lure people to their death. They are called Astra Glides and they wear Void Slips. *wink*",,,,,
It's' Genii tech level (from Stargate Atlantis). Or early Stargate SG-1 tech level from their early encounters abroad and tech appropriation.,,,,,
With the release of Harbinger,,,,,
ATCon will be my one year Beariversary,,,,,
Josh,,,,,
Any monk equivalent? Perhaps with lightsabre type weps?,,,,,
Is there anything you can tell us here about the narrative of Harbinger? Any big bad you can tease? :),,,,,
Watching the playtest got they hype train rolling for me. I hope this kicks off,,,,,
Brandish,,,,,
Is it just human beings that you can play as? (Just wondering,,,,,
That was a lot of detail to get through! *round of applause,,,,,
What are the best ways to financially support this project? Patreon?,,,,,
Rules for exploring new planets?? Cause that would be badass.,,,,,
Love them there glasses. // Tim's Face,,,,,
I'm playing Zelda. -M,,,,,

Idea: There is an actual globe in the middle of the room,,,,,
I haven't been following the campaign,,,,,
Thanks for this,,,,,
But also getting pretty inspired~ Have a game to run tomorrow,,,,,
Awesome Barker! The book is worth it,,,,,
Yes,,,,,
Well ladies and gents,,,,,
It's hilarious that the doc is changing in front of me several minutes before you talk about it in the live feed.,,,,,
Hey what's up Barker. When can I get my hands on some more Enchea content?,,,,,
Well,,,,,
Not sure if you know Barker but your live chat keeps freezing and cutting out.,,,,,
Not sure about Facebook. Facebook Live Videos seem to just hang in the upload window and I can't catch them live. Always end up watching them later after the fact.,,,,,
I'm not commenting much,,,,,
Howdy,,,,,
Looks like Lloyd Collins,,,,,
The feed keeps freezing and jumping.,,,,,
I imagine this globe rotating very slowly,,,,,
Gotta admire this dogged determination!,,,,,
whew found you again,,,,,
That wasn't it Michael Barker,,,,,
So I want to write a setting for an rpg I would love to make someday,,,,,
Requiem for a Dinosaur Lasagna XD,,,,,
I always prefered OneNote over Googledocs (or evernote if that is your drive),,,,,
I just finished a castle drawing for my daughters social studies class,,,,,
New to Ab Tab so I'll eventually be looking into getting some of your guy's products,,,,,
"""Trying to mess around with the technolo-"" VIDEO INTERRUPTED",,,,,
This was a good time to join the stream,,,,,
Loved harbinger playtest vid.  Want in on that!,,,,,
Much <3 - Beautiful work,,,,,
Updated it?  Oh hell yeah will definitely redownload.,,,,,
Phenomenal book!  Need to redownload that,,,,,
We all evolve as we DM more and more.,,,,,
Que pasa,,,,,
Might use it for my game Saturday,,,,,
Be A Better Barker Master...whaddup?,,,,,
Hey Barker! How are you doing?,,,,,
Hello everyone again!,,,,,
Hey barker,,,,,
Love you barker,,,,,
Wassup,,,,,
Hello!,,,,,
What's,,,,,
What up Barks,,,,,
Hey B-dog!,,,,,
No,,,,,
Bein' a healthy boy,,,,,
Working on new fighter,,,,,
Lords of Ash sounds like something straight from Dark Souls,,,,,
working on a frame work for greek mythology setting Mythic Heroes,,,,,
The Lords of Ash might be my favourite element of Dragongrin. I see them as keepers of the keys and I can see thousands of story's and adventures centring around them,,,,,
So ready for this book,,,,,
Tim as a person who develops his own world. What was the reason you started to work on something new instead of changing something that is already there?,,,,,
Classes are so difficult. It's a little easier with Harbinger because we're not trying to make them synergize with existing 5E classes. But STILL.,,,,,
You guys are adding to the wheel that already exist so it rolls with many different systems,,,,,
I HATE Thor's short hair. I say that because original Thor was a fucking dream and then the cut hair,,,,,
I want to run Dragongrin like Shadow of Mordor. Fight your way into power and use the Dismembered Lords forces against him!,,,,,
I think the regional sections in Dead Man's Guide are the part I'm most excited about it. It's so nicely laid out.,,,,,
Remember that 5E seems to be creating archetypes meant to replace mutliclass combos,,,,,
The main difference in my mind are that I don't see the Lords of Ash really working together.,,,,,
Chris,,,,,
Are you using parts of be a batter campaign master 2 to build this book / setting?,,,,,
Are you going to detail factions in Dead Mans? For instance a faction of Monster Hunters!!,,,,,
Plus a Dragongrin features that work with the setting better than the phb.,,,,,
Barker demonstrated the power of the war makers in our Dragongrin Chronicles. Super OP,,,,,
Working on my living recap document. This is going to be longer than expected!,,,,,
What about backgrounds,,,,,
There is someone a little like Batman in The Copper Sun named Stanchion Corsica.,,,,,
"""Dread Father",,,,,
Wasn't the Dread Father the monster you guys wrote that watches over orphans.,,,,,
I'm so happy that Harbinger has so many heavy magical elements. Really helps it stand apart from being just generic Firefly or Stark Trek with fantasy,,,,,
I'd love to read some Harbinger short fiction stories.,,,,,
Be cool if the ships have Astra Fade too and you can try and push the ship in a dire situation,,,,,
i have a really good idea what my One Shot (Chain Reaction) will entail. I've got placeholder elements until the playtest comes out,,,,,
You should check out the videogame SOMA,,,,,
Sorceries of Harbinger are what happens when you combine astra,,,,,
"That last ""Hehhh"" of your laugh at some our jokes sounds like you're genuinely laughing then  decide it was a bad joke.",,,,,
Looking forward to running Harbinger,,,,,
Can you give us any background information about the septs and world politics or factions?,,,,,
I Imagine this system will be perfect for a high tech wild west game would you agree?,,,,,
Just listening to the AbTab guys talking about harbinger makes me die with desire to run it haha,,,,,
Have you thought any more about the power armor/mech-suits in Harbinger?,,,,,
Is Harbinger going to be one big book,,,,,
Are there any creatures that are based off of the Xenomorph from Aliens?,,,,,
Can't wait to run my Harbinger one shot it's gonna be epic!!!!,,,,,
It's like they're running around in Harbinger with some black soul gems hahah.,,,,,
You missed the nerd shrine explanation. Your life remains incomplete.,,,,,
Monster house the movie now monster ship,,,,,
Been dying for an epic sci-fi 5e conversion and this is exactly what I've been wanting,,,,,
I do not toss it around lightly,,,,,
I like the comic stuff behind you. Would you show us a few things there?,,,,,
Just Matt explaining the basics of Harbinger,,,,,
Is there going to be a space ship sheet,,,,,
No black astra? You ruled out the cool power ranger ahah,,,,,
Overall the specter vessel concept sounds really nice so far.,,,,,
In space no one can hear you dream.,,,,,

Sam,,,,,
Kristoph is from Tacoma,,,,,
Dude,,,,,
We make sick body kit footie for drifters. // Tim,,,,,
Hey everyone! // Tim,,,,,
If you're looking for political adventure kits,,,,,
We've been needing an adventure module format overhaul for a while! The official stuff is so out of touch with the way we play the game here in the AbTab group :). Can't wait to see what you guys came up with!,,,,,
As a noob DM,,,,,
Well,,,,,
Flavor text actually tends to encourage me to be stiff and just read...,,,,,
BTW,,,,,
I'm really excited about the Adventure Kit - totally going to be useful to me as a noob DM,,,,,
Jeff doty will be in 3 reskins....should get feedback from him,,,,,
Wierdly I feel like a bunch of Enchea Adventure Kits would fit better than a big single book.,,,,,
Jungles seem to be one environment with little dnd material.,,,,,
I made sand shark minions that after they killed they discovered they were full of snakes.,,,,-0.2023,
Will there be any type of character creation in the adventure kit,,,,,
So would you say this is better than a adventure module for a group of first time players,,,,,
If you guys plan on running any more play tests I would love to become a part,,,,,
So is the playtest being released to a select few,,,,,
This adventure kit sounds like one of the best ideas,,,,,
I have only GMed one or two campaigns,,,,,
I'm super excited for these. Especially Frozen King,,,,,
Can't wait to get this. Pdf only? Or will i be able to get a hard copy,,,,,
We plan on doing all types for all sorts of styles and worlds,,,,,
My game last night was done using the Adventure Kit,,,,,
I will be running an Oath of the Frozen King playtest adventure on the 13th on the MTD youtube channel.,,,,,
That monster generator would be super cool as a card set :),,,,,
Tim: asdasda..asdas..a.d.a... what would drive a man to do such a thing?,,,,,
In a way,,,,,
This is great because I've wanted to run a Viking theme game for awhile. I was looking to venture to Varnholme,,,,,
Love the adventure kit idea btw. Modules always seemed like too much work for not enough payoff for the way I like to run games. These seem like a beautiful sweet spot between only prep and modules!,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,
On a similar note,,,,,
I need this kit right now It takes me far too long to settle on a one shot I want to run,,,,,
Michael,,,,,
Are there samples available for use right now? I need some inspiration for my upcoming session on Saturday lol,,,,,
Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed a few specific worlds we mentioned in the last newsletter / blog post,,,,,
Still waiting for the next Be a Better Campaign master... Barker!! *shakes fist futiley*,,,,,
I guess we derailed a bit,,,,,
Tim,,,,,
FYI--My playtest adventure is 100% created from the Adventure Kit. I have not once cracked a WotC source book to create this adventure.,,,,,
I just decided right now that i am going to reskin another version of this as....wait for it...,,,,,
Nobody else I know is doing this. Another step in the 'By GMs,,,,,
This is exactly what I've been wanting out of an adventure module. I'm sold.,,,,,
I have planned for at least one encounter being rolled on the spot.,,,,,
Yeah Tim,,,,,
With allmost 90% done what will the Kickstarter pay for?,,,,,
Do you have a rough timeline for the KickStarter,,,,,
Here is the link to sign up for the ATCON newsletter!  http://eepurl.com/czqqmD,,,,,
I love the idea of allowing the narrative to dictate the mechanics. Your idea of the quick sand encounter is a perfect subversion to the pacy encounter. Make it gruelling and hammer them with mechanical checks to bog them down and make their doom seem inevitable! :),,,,,
Nope,,,,,
I'm tellin' yah guys . . . this thumbnail is somethin' else.,,,,,
I prep three things,,,,,
I often struggle with wondering how much is railroading and how much is way too vague to be fun,,,,,
On their way back to the village,,,,,
I give my players a random magic item they find at level one,,,,,
What I'll do is find a stat block that matches what I want mechanically,,,,,
Maybe the quicksand,,,,,
You could just run the encounter as you planned!  The scenario the players chose against can be some other enemy that you never made up! :),,,,,
Literally about to go live and TIM EXPLODES onto my feed! Can't beat your solid ratings! You watch the game,,,,,
That's a great tip Tim. Let the players go and do what they want so they have agency,,,,,
This is a very close interpretation of my own approach with The Rule of Three.  I love it.,,,,,
I don't do very much prep,,,,,
It's  a good idea. I'd rather make up new encounters,,,,,
I prep a world and improve based on player input mostly ;-),,,,,
They come back and another party is there making trouble for the town.,,,,,
Or the quicksand can still happen. The players just happen to not choose the other path...,,,,,
That'd be odd,,,,,
If the enemy got beat too easily,,,,,
No harm in planning some contingency plans if they go left instead of right. :),,,,,
Dang,,,,,
Yo yo! Abtabternoon to you too! May your dice roll high!,,,,,
Howdy doo! I'm going to be there AND be square!,,,,,
Sorry all,,,,,
Tim literally demonstrated his principle,,,,,
He didn't like that he only had 2 people watching ahhh. Lol,,,,,
Hello all,,,,,
Whats going on this fine afternoon everybody,,,,,
Howdy again,,,,,

Beautiful healthy cats!,,,,,
I WANT THEM 😍 Also One of my cats would swipe the ham of my hand if she saw it dangling.,,,,,
I love hamtime,,,,,
So many black beauties!,,,,,
Shiro Brasington,,,,,
What’s your point saying he didn’t eat it? It is still your duty to share ALL of da fudz. How can a cat decide if he wants to eat it if you don’t share? Also,,,,,
Alfie licks popcorn too,,,,,
They just want to be involved! :D,,,,,
Oh,,,,,
Ha! I am proud of myself as I was trying to decide who the black beauty was,,,,,
Or 'not' 😂😂,,,,,
Really nice Does he sell women's watches too?,,,,,
Total scam. Their main design selling point is no longer a reality. They changed the wheel design (among many other things). It’s now an ordinary looking travel case. What a disappointment. Buyer beware!  This video is totally fake!,,,,,

Hi David L. Whitlow III We're sorry to hear that. We'll send you more information in Inbox.,,,,,
Ng Xue Qi,,,,,

Looking magnificent!  Can't wait to get my physical copy of Aeternum.,,,,,

Looks awesome! Btw 28mm scale refers to ground to eye level not overall height but still cool to know how tall she will be in total :-D,,,,,
Is the cost going to be the same for international orders vs domestic ones?,,,,,
Great to hear about the scale clarification.  Is it possible to see a picture of the miniature next to others brands for comparison purpose? Maybe a N3 Infinity and a GW Space Marine as they are the most extended sci-fi miniatures,,,,,

Hey guys. Here's a great German review of 'One Day I'll Fly Away'. What a great song.   https://soundtrack-of-my-life.com/2016/12/19/vaults-klassik-trifft-elektro-fuer-weihnachten/,,,,,
"Already on the apple music! Pretty Awesome!! Been listening to""Bloodflow"" all day long.",,,,,
Best track on the album... Thank you for making music to our ears.,,,,,
Already out in Australia and got it Thursday night on iTunes. Bodies is a smash,,,,,
Sooo excited! What time tomorrow?,,,,,
Mine not turned up,,,,,
I know US tour dates are harder to arrange. Are there any plans to tour the states?,,,,,
Can not wait!!,,,,,
I LOVE THIS SONG!!! But it's driving me crazy trying to find the correct lyrics. Really inconsistent on google. Do you have official lyrics posted?,,,,,
Damn! America needs this music too!,,,,,
Already booked for Manchester! Same venue as last time?,,,,,
Can't wait to see you in Manchester,,,,,
See you at the Haunt in Feb!,,,,,

What gig was this?,,,,,
Ayshwarya Balasubramanian,,,,,
I ADORE her dress and she's super amazing and magical LOVE Vaults,,,,,
I'm not too happy with this version. The live version was better. At 02:41 was rushed a little and couldn't hear you. In the live version you sounded beautiful and it was from your heart and soul. That's the only disappointing aspect. Now hurricane was great live and studio. Good job. Your music really affected my life in a major way. Thank you. You saved my life. But blood flows my favorite and wished you could fix it. With love_ matthew,,,,,
One of my favourites! Your lyrics are always great but these are so visceral and expressive. It's interesting to hear the difference between this and the live version,,,,,
Suena fantástico... Javo,,,,,
I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am for this album!,,,,,
I only got Hurricane downloaded from my itunes purchase? Not a prob as I purchased the other two tracks previously,,,,,
Hi again,,,,,

The recycling one starts Sunday! Question- all of our industrial recycling centers are closed on Sundays (so like,,,,,
If your city has zero recycling facilities,,,,,
If we have recycle day on a day that’s not on the daily challenge can we take a picture that day and submit it on the day if the challenge or does it have to be a picture that day of the challenge,,,,,
I know there is a specific teaching day,,,,,
This is seriously such an amazing idea! Thank you team grovia for helping inspire people to protect the earth and be more green!,,,,,
For the get outside Day..... what are some examples of “different” things that can be submitted separately?,,,,,
Would food from a small locally owned business count? Even if some of their food isn’t locally sourced?,,,,,
Kim - Ian stopped nursing while you are talking! I think he loved meeting you last weekend at MommyCon!,,,,,
Let’s say each member of my team did 10 different activities related to the daily challenge. We each submitted 10 pics. Would that be considered 50 points then?,,,,,
I am wondering about day one recycling. Can I do and take pictures of my things Saturday and just post them Sunday. Most of our recycling facilities are closed Sundays,,,,,
With green eating could buying in bulk and using reusable bags work? Struggling with ideas up here in Alberta.,,,,,
We’ve got Carlton to our advantage here.,,,,,
Kelly’s closet was so fun!,,,,,
I can't wait!!! I've got hubby commissioned to help!,,,,,
Does setting your recycling out for curbside recycling count??,,,,,
So multiple steps gets multiple points?,,,,,
What about like Thrift shopping? Is that Recycling?,,,,,
Each member has to do one of their own daily,,,,,
Do we do a submission form for each picture we take?,,,,,
It’s 80 here!!! I’m so excited we finally got some warm weather!,,,,,

Kiwi pies!,,,,,
Looks so good!!,,,,,
I basically just need another baby.,,,,,
My husband never remembers to unsnap so wondering if I have to sift through dirty diapers to unsnap before washing or if I cans wait till they’re clean to separate.,,,,,
Yes now I have baby fever as well lol,,,,,
I hope to get pregnant soon so I can start cloth sooner this time!!,,,,,
Shells were so great for travelling with a 4 month old!  I could hand wash them in a sink and stuff them for day or night as needed!,,,,,
I know you said this already but I missed it. How many diapers for newborn stash?,,,,,
We’re hoping to have a newborn to diaper soon!! We didn’t start cloth diapering our son until he was 5 weeks so I can’t wait!!,,,,,
Have both prefolds been washed many times? Just trying to get an idea of what I am working with. I have size 2 prefolds,,,,,
Do you need to unsnap the inserts in a hybrid before you launder or can you leave it snapped in?,,,,,
Love our Grovia prefolds and our H&L shells! Can’t wait to use them on another tiny squish 😍,,,,,
Jamie you don’t have to unsnap ONES and they don’t get stretched out though so I was wondering about these.,,,,,
With hybrids I always unsnap insert because I dry the shells and inserts differently,,,,,
I can’t wait to have another baby to use a nb stash!,,,,,
Anna they did for me! I used the size 1 prefolds with the shells as small as they would go.,,,,,
That’s a nifty trick. I wouldn’t have thought of that.,,,,,
Were on number 5!!!! Can’t wait to cloth again and this is my goal to NB cloth this go round ❤️,,,,,
Prefolds are so great and grovia cloth wipes as a booster,,,,,
Glad you mentioned to line dry the pail liners,,,,,
I wish I had more hook and loop shells when my baby was tiny,,,,,
I can't wait to cloth a newborn!,,,,,
Polly I was talking about the inserts with the hybrids not the ONE’s,,,,,
I love learning all these little tricks you show!!,,,,,
Gahhhh i missed it!!! Wrong time zone😭😭 mommy brain🤦🏽‍♀️,,,,,
Kw days they say leave it alone,,,,,

Hi!!!! 💙💙💙 We've never tried GroVia but I always drool over the perfect prints!,,,,,

I love mine,,,,,
Hi sabrina.. I'm sorry if I missed it but what's your favorite trim booster to put into your Ones? For night time.,,,,,
I just ordered bioliners for the first time on the 1st!,,,,,
The graphics have been SO GOOD.,,,,,
Once you figure out your combo,,,,,
My love for prefolds has grown. We only have three right now. NEED MORE!!,,,,,
I looooove the Organic Cotton! It's sooo trim.,,,,,
Share the details before she comes!,,,,,
I use only the small one and my 10 month old woke up wet for the first time,,,,,
The small ONE insert fits amazing in side,,,,,
I use my shells like AIO,,,,,
Ismael is waving at you!,,,,,
You saw me spy your Hie prototype wallet at  mason baby LOL,,,,,
I’ve used both always I don’t wanna chance it lol,,,,,
Basically I don’t discriminate when it comes to GroVia we use it all 🤣🤣🤣,,,,,
They are sooooo soft and easy to wash,,,,,
I love the absorbency of prefolds but I like inserts Bc of the TPU and my shells stay dryer!,,,,,
We got bioliners Bc we started solids and 🤢😷,,,,,
I already ordered- free ship gets me every time,,,,,
Hahaha I LOVE your enthusiasm!!!,,,,,
My 6 month old has always needed a booster lol,,,,,
I’m gonna have to order some prefolds and see what it’s all about.,,,,,
BTW everyone... Sloomb has pants,,,,,
Sloomb has wool in these prints already,,,,,
There was a mama last week looking for a fall colored diaper for her son to wear as ring bearer in a wedding.. Fennec would be perfect!,,,,,

Need thatfor my maybe baby. 😍😍 sugar rush is love,,,,,
Is the pink and purple all Grovia colors? I haven't seen that in sllomb!,,,,,

Hiii!,,,,,
👀👀👀,,,,,
Wish I could,,,,,
I thought I was out of view🙈,,,,,
I see me😂,,,,,
Hiiii,,,,,
What kind of wipe case is shown in this video? I want one that will carry my cloth wipes 🙂,,,,,
I want one so bad. 😭,,,,,
Can't wait for next week!!,,,,,
Totally dancing off-camera here!,,,,,
@Allisa it should be a flat $20 for the bag!,,,,,
Holly's husband just took her Basalt Hie on a work trip!,,,,,
From shoulder to backpack!,,,,,
Diaper Junction We hope you are having an awesome Hie Launch!!!,,,,,
Luna,,,,,
Yes! Pass-through charging,,,,,
Hey!! That’s me :),,,,,
WOOHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,,,,,
Will we see the wipes case available at some point?,,,,,
Say hi to lisa. She's shipping my snow today :),,,,,
I might pick one up for my kiddo. She has decided to be a vegetarian (of course hardly any options at school for that) and she is so rough with her lunch boxes. 😂,,,,,
The cooler fits so much! We went to the park the other day and had two water bottles,,,,,
You can tandem charge,,,,,
I just ordered a Coulee wallet for a neutral color. I have Carmine right now. Figured two wallets is necessary.,,,,,
One of my guy friends who travels for work all the time got one for a carryon after i explained how great they were 😉,,,,,
Could you put I‎t on 😬 I’d like to see what it looks like as a backpack worn in real life. Sorry. Thanks!!,,,,,
I almost just got the wallet and an hour before my husband said treat yo self and get the bag too. Bless him. 💜,,,,,
I do that too! It sits at the perfect level so you don’t have to put it down when you’re changing your baby.,,,,,
Oh! And my kid ripped off the sticker of the wipes and i just turned it around and the pod has kept them moist.,,,,,
Th wallet is nice. It's bigger than what I usually use,,,,,
I want to see tutorials as to how to pack this thing because I can't seem to get as much as others can in here!😂,,,,,
I totally took my pod only the other day and threw my wallet,,,,,
Haha. I do that all the time. Pod holds the dirties when I forget wet bags,,,,,
Yes I can’t wait to make mine ride piggyback on my roller suitcase #hienerd,,,,,
Will the stroller straps be available to purchase to be used with a pod?,,,,,
I’m sorry,,,,,
I am so glad I was in on the Kickstarter !!!,,,,,
So much easier than another brand on a stroller that I had to purchase separately! Goes on easy adjusts easy and works! Everything about the Hie is my jam! #easyamdsmooth,,,,,
You look amazing,,,,,
I need this bag!! 😭😭especially since we go to Disney so much! Also what is the stroller? 👀,,,,,
That baby bump 😍😍😍,,,,,
So,,,,,
I spy a baby bump. 💖💖,,,,,
baby bump lookin good! 💗,,,,,
Why you so cute!!!,,,,,
Thank you! I am so happy to know I wasn't the only one who was doing this wrong. 😂😂,,,,,
I was definitely using them wrong! Thank you. Now I feel bad for emailing customer service asking about them. 🙈 sorry,,,,,
Was deffffinitely doing it incorrectly. When it didn't hold the weight of my bag (with not a lot in it) I knew there must be a correct way....and TA-DA!,,,,,
This is making me want to get a Hie bag more and more now!,,,,,
Omg. That’s genius. I knew I was doing it wrong but couldn’t figure it out. HIE needs to come with a user manual! Lol,,,,,
Ah!! This makes so much more sense!!! I was doing it wrong!!!,,,,,
Thank you so much! I knew it had to be user error!,,,,,
I was wondering about this!! Thank you,,,,,
I knew there had to be another way to use them 😲👍❤️,,,,,
Thank you! I was totally using it wrong!,,,,,
Oh my gosh this makes so much more sense!,,,,,
Samantha have you used yours yet ?  I used mine in the shopping cart at foodlion,,,,,
My one question which I haven’t seen asked yet is about battery life. Say I fully charged the battery and haven’t needed to use it for a couple weeks. Next time I go to use it will it still have a full charge?  How long does the battery keep it’s charge?,,,,,
My one “dislike” about the bag was that it never latches properly! Definitely going to try to roll the flap tomorrow! Thank you for this information!!,,,,,
Ahhhh! How many Hies are still waiting to leave the warehouse? The tracking  number says mine has been waiting for pick up since January 11. The suspense is torture!!!,,,,,
is the wallet going to be available for everyone to purchase?,,,,,
Will the lights on the joey be all green and not flashing when fully charged?,,,,,
The sides of my bag are sticking out farther than my lid. I keep just tucking them back in,,,,,
I couldn’t back the Kickstarter but looking forward to the release does the charger come with the bag or is it a separate purchase? Same question for the key fob.,,,,,
Already using mine and the bag closes so much easier now.  I needed the tutorial for the joey   Thank you. I am using mine as a work bag and diaper bag only when I’m with the grandkids,,,,,
I wish I could have funded the kickstarter,,,,,
Thanks for sharing this video Kim ❤️ I was having a love/hate relationship with the snap closure. I would just touch the top flap and the bag would pop open. After rolling it,,,,,
Do you have plans to sell individual joey chargers? I'd like to get a second 😝,,,,,
Kwinna Glades Slade this is the best and biggest bag on the market!! You neeeeeeed it when it gets released!,,,,,
Zabs McGee,,,,,
Katie Hom,,,,,
Jamie Mitchell,,,,,
AND,,,,,
I have buyers remorse. I got Carmine but I neeeeeeed Basalt!! 😩,,,,,
Yes! He’s done two road trips. It was so fun meeting him the first year with Holly and catching up again the next year!,,,,,
This is the best unpacking video of all time x it really shows the reaction better I’m going get my sister to unpack mine,,,,,
Daniel asked mr Andy if it was comfy for a guy to wear as we have yet to pull our backpack straps out,,,,,
I had thw opportunity to meet them both on the perfect :),,,,,
Diapered Jelly cats next week!!!!!,,,,,
Amanda McLaughlin I want the bag..maybe baby 3...muhahaha,,,,,
So fun. I got my basalt and a wipes case today too 😁😂,,,,,
I didn’t know he fished... and i was totally picturing a tackle box in there 😂,,,,,
It looks so good on him!!! It’s a total man bag too!,,,,,
Did he find the key fob?? He’s adorable,,,,,
He could totally use it as a GrandDad bag 😬,,,,,
This is perfect for reaction purposes to someone who knows nothing about it!!! Great idea!,,,,,
I’m so afraid he is going to cut it with that blade😂,,,,,
How much does Hie weigh before you put your nappies and personal stuff in?,,,,,
I would have to go to Texas for that Christina lol,,,,,
I forgot about the zippered pockets on that side!!,,,,,
I met Andy and holly at purrrfect road trip in Kansas City!,,,,,
Oh no kw my oldest son wants one to go fishing with,,,,,
Tell him to find the backpack straps by himself😂,,,,,
You arent holding her wipes case? Lol,,,,,
Hi Holly,,,,,
We were living at the same time I think!!!,,,,,
Meagan you should have your Grandpa open yours 🤦🏼‍♀️,,,,,
just a heads up,,,,,
Indeed glitchy,,,,,
If somenone is going to bring my Hie by plane they have to remove the whole Joey square to bring as a carry on luggage. Is it right!?,,,,,
When will this be available for purchase ??,,,,,
If I got a notification this morning from FedEx saying it was out for delivery,,,,,
Would we email GroVia’s customer service with questions or another email?  Thanks for this video. You answered one of my questions!,,,,,
I'm embarrassed to ask,,,,,
How can I purchase a key fob? I wasn't aware they were hand hand with the magnet for the keys.,,,,,
That was a great video. Super helpful.    Also loving your adorable baby belly!,,,,,
Can’t wait for mine to come! Any idea when they expect all orders to be shipped? I love the logistics of all this 💙,,,,,
Is the wallet shaped kinda like the Hie logo or is it supposed to be symmetrical?,,,,,
Thank you! I removed my entire joey to charge it 😳 lol,,,,,
What are the black straps that came with the bag?,,,,,
Thanks for the update about FedEx!,,,,,
I received my order today and everything is in my box,,,,,
How long does it take to fully charge the Joey?,,,,,
So if we don’t see it’s shipped by Friday should we contact customer service? Mine still says pending...,,,,,
I know there were some glitches with tracking,,,,,
How much will it sell for when it hits retailers?,,,,,
Before the prosecution team attacks Kim,,,,,
I’m distracted by that wall...😍 Oh and your cute little belly😍,,,,,
I’m embarrassed at how much I needed that instructional on the Joey!!! I had to google yesterday because I wasn’t sure! But it’s AWESOME,,,,,
Nicole de Jong she explains about the magnet taking some time to lock properly.,,,,,
Great video. I'm patiently waiting to get mine today.,,,,,
Monique Zavala Rice look!!! 😍😍😍😍,,,,,
Additionally,,,,,
Jenn Johnson  Yes,,,,,
One of the options Jennifer can offer you IS your Wipes Case,,,,,
Asruh-Tue Warner We've been testing for months and not had an issue when your wipes case gets low on wipes.  It doesn't change the fit.,,,,,
Yep.....just make sure the dispenser sits on the outside of the opening and it easily opens.  Seventh Generation FITS.,,,,,
Yes,,,,,
Email jennifer@grovia.com if you're missing anything in your order!,,,,,
The straps are super high quality webbing and are indeed very similar to seat belts.,,,,,
You can also just pack a travel-sized portion!,,,,,
Meghan Shaddix The Pod is 15inches wide. 6.5 high. 3inches deep,,,,,
Kate LaHaise Kerr We did use an OXO while designing the Pod and it does fit.,,,,,
Kroger Store Brand....FITS,,,,,
Huggies.....all styles....FIT,,,,,

Hi Sabrina!!!!  ~Kim Ormsby,,,,,
So excited!! Is it December yet!?,,,,,

Can’t wait til dec/Jan whenever mine ship!,,,,,
Can't wait! Wish it was here Wednesday for our first cross country trip with two littles 😬,,,,,
Can't wait for hie! This diaper nag is perfection,,,,,
Can’t wait!!!,,,,,
I am counting down!,,,,,
Angela Brooks,,,,,
so excited!-Sabrina,,,,,
Am I the only one who thinks this is way too big to use as a diaper bag? Makes sense as a travel bag,,,,,
A water bottle! Will that still fit when it's this full?,,,,,
Giggling at her two noisy toys for the plane 🙃 that's how we pack! 🤷‍♀️,,,,,
Im jealous Holland doesnt magically know there is only one spare shell and thus ruin them in quick succession.  My kid does.  Never fails.,,,,,
What was the name of the red magnetic  toy ?,,,,,
Change of clothes for Holland! Never fails you'll need them when you forget them.,,,,,
Charge cord for the joey,,,,,
Looks great! But I have to ask again,,,,,
Looks awesome! I love how those full boxes of chocolates fits so nicely with room for other things! So,,,,,
Emergency Daniel tiger 😂 we were just watching Daniel. Hugga wugga,,,,,
Am I the only person who puts extra underwear for me in my carry on? Just in case?!,,,,,
Love this bag.. cant wait Right now i use a thirty one bag,,,,,
Probably way too late  for this question. Is there a clear pocket inside for emergency contact info to be kept?,,,,,
I’m due with #5 in October!! I’m putting money aside every Check for this bag!!! I can’t wait! I did want to double double check though,,,,,
I seriously can not wait for this bag!! Our strap on our current diaper bag has broken twice now (we had the first replaced) because we overstuff it. December can not come soon enough ❤️,,,,,
That is so impressive! Makes me wonder how I have been functioning with my current bag,,,,,
I am absolutely in love! This is the color I chose and everything! Almost every outing I say I wish I had my hie!,,,,,
You forgot caramels! Lol! I want this bag,,,,,
I shall look into those flat toys for travel!  Looks much more compact!,,,,,
I definitely want to find some flat toys! Seem to be space savers.,,,,,
I learned to wear to put my Chargers for easy access to them.,,,,,
I can't wait to get my bag. Super excited. Love it,,,,,
What is that magnet toy thing,,,,,
Water Bottle,,,,,
👏👏👏 Thank you,,,,,
Oops! That was me. -Laura,,,,,
I've been off of Facebook a lot and I just saw this video. Kim. I love it so much ❤ I am so excited!! Everything I am seeing is so amazing. And I can't wait! 😀😀😀,,,,,
Yes! Will we have it by Christmas???,,,,,
How many cloth wipes will it hold?,,,,,
The 45oz Hydroflask is the same width as the 32,,,,,
I am so glad I backed for two bags,,,,,
Not a fan of the velcro. I feel like it's not going to hold up. Snaps would be better I think.,,,,,
Will there be a weight limit for the key fob to be able to hold your keys in the bag?,,,,,
The kickstarter diapers will have a special tag?,,,,,
Does a toddler contigo fit in the cooler?,,,,,
Tucking of straps!,,,,,
This is going to be so amazing for mommas with special needs kiddos. I'm so excited to be able to carry one bag with both medical and diapering items. This is AMAZING!!,,,,,
I'll be using a backpack the first few weeks I have my baby because no way am I  buying another diaper bag while waiting for this sweet bag to arrive  😍,,,,,
Every time I see a live I am more and more thankful I backed and cannot wait!  Fingers crossed it comes in time for Christmas holidays!!!!!,,,,,
Do your big kids just think you're the coolest mom ever?! You're so inspiring! This bag is great and I hope it is crazy successful for you. 👏,,,,,
Love the bag! Can't wait to see the wipes case. And this video makes me realize how much hie withdrawal I had since the last video! Thanks for a great product that so much thought,,,,,
Monique Zavala Rice Kerry Bushnell and you guys made fun of how excited I was for this bag! Look at all the amazing features AND I'll be cloth diapering two so I'll need it all lol,,,,,
Wallet clip?,,,,,
Is the inside magnet still a thing?,,,,,
Is that supposed to keep the keys in?,,,,,
How hard is it tuck the backpack straps in?,,,,,
Do you know if we will have the bag before Christmas? For Christmas travel? 🤞,,,,,
So excited to see hie! I feel like it's been a while 😊😊😊,,,,,
Will it be in for Christmas travel?,,,,,
Your shirt is juuuust a little bit Carmine,,,,,
I begged her to do it tonight instead of tomorrow! 🙈 -Laura,,,,,

YASSSSSS-Sabrina,,,,,
Perfect! -Laura,,,,,
You look awesome!! <3 -Laura,,,,,
Still Carmine fan over here lol-Sabrina,,,,,
I know it's kind of silly,,,,,
Love the cup holder.  Does this have the wallet clip inside???,,,,,
Man I was really hoping for a wetbag clip somewhere on #3 😭,,,,,
I would actually love the Hie blue in the exclusives! Can't we do that???? 😩😂,,,,,
Any chance the insulated pouch will have waterproof (YKK) zippers?,,,,,
If it weren't for the diaper pod and changing pad this Could be an awesome school bag,,,,,
Does it come with a charging cord or do you have to get your own cord?,,,,,
Micki Turner Jarman,,,,,
@Shannon,,,,,
@Tracey Sweatmon Dumpit,,,,,
They will start to go through tonight when the campaign  closes,,,,,
It can be a different card because one is processed by Kickstarter and one is processed by Backer Kit.,,,,,
Kickstarter will start processing credit cards TONIGHT when the campaign ends. It won't all happen at once,,,,,
First charge will be processed by Kickstarter; second one will be on 8/1 and will be processed by BackerKit.,,,,,
Key fob mold is being poured and then they'll make a few samples to choose one.,,,,,
Don't be waiting on the Carmine redip and forget to get it in! -Laura,,,,,
Christine Bondi Cerrato,,,,,
That release was your first Live for us in Families!! <3,,,,,
Oh! BackerKit cannot take PayPal. They use Stripe to process credit cards. Sorry! -Laura,,,,,
Dress up like a cone 😂,,,,,
All shipped together,,,,,
Wallet CAN be different from the bag. -Laura,,,,,
I'll go post it. :),,,,,
Mountain time!,,,,,

Heyyyyyyy my beautiful teammate! <3 -Laura,,,,,
Rewards surveys will start to go out Monday. They will also be sent in batches! They can't all go out at once. Please be patient. :) The survey will go to the email inbox associated with your Kickstarter account (or your Facebook account if you signed up for Kickstarter using your Facebook account) and it will come from BackerKit.,,,,,
Violet Dots,,,,,
There's no Lavender. :p It's Violet!,,,,,
Violet!,,,,,
Ummm....this threw me off a bit....,,,,,
I have a question. I just found out my sister is getting me Hie for a Christmas present,,,,,
Can anyone tell me if backing the $670 level Allows for shipping to 2 different locations?,,,,,
Just for clarification,,,,,
Can we choose this as the grovia/j&j wetbag as part of the pledge reward on the 180 pledge?,,,,,
If I go in and pledge tomorrow at the $150 level does that get me the wallet too or just the bag?,,,,,
Is it still possible to get the ice cream wetbags free? 😬,,,,,
Just to confirm I did this right. I'm at $180 level plus the $15 shipping I was in for $195. I want two ice cream wet bags. I went to manage account and made my pledge $215. Is this right? Or do I do it somewhere else?,,,,,
I think I need help,,,,,
Looks like those wetbags are pulling in more people!! :),,,,,
alex moyer at the end it shows the kick out part where it extends,,,,,
So excited!,,,,,
The pod is the #1 thing I wanted,,,,,
So many things. Phone charger because of the obvious reasons. I take a ton of pictures and we FaceTime a lot with family so if we're on the go having that readily available will be amazing. The diaper pod because I hate bringing my entire bag into restrooms with us. The structure to prevent tipping. I hate that my bag now falls over so easily. The multiple carry positions with padded straps! And last but not least the versatility. I love that I will be able to use this after my kiddos are out of diapers.,,,,,
This might sound silly,,,,,
While this isn't my favorite feature,,,,,
The fact that it can hold three pods I have three boys and I plan on giving each of them a pod with a change of clothes extra socks and their own wipes,,,,,
For me,,,,,
I like the diaper pod with it's own changing pad. We ordered this for our granddaughter Hope,,,,,
Fits a laptop! No more juggling multiple bags!,,,,,
Would the pocket for the charging phone fit phablets? or just regular skinny sized phones?,,,,,
Phone charger and carry on bag size!!! It is the perfect business bag! My baby is almost out of diapers but this Mama loooves this bag so much! It will make the perfect weekend bag and I love the back pack straps! My shoulder can't handle a full bag on side. Backpack straps are key!,,,,,
Easy access and removable pod. And the phone charger. And the key pocket. Basically all of it,,,,,
"1) The fact that you can run errands/travel without worrying that your phone will die 2) I can grab the pod and bring that to the bathroom for a quick change vs taking the whole bag 3) I can bring my laptop in the same bag that I'm using as my diaper bag.   I'm so excited for this bag!!  Perfect for a mom that works full time and travels.    It's the ""I'm superwoman and can do it all"" bag 😂",,,,,
The diaper pod and charger. I usually carry a wetbag with essentials instead of my full diaper bag,,,,,
I am most impressed that it does everything you could ever want a diaper bag to do. And all one-handed! Because #MomLife. #butdoesitchargeyourphone,,,,,
I am literally the most impressed my the fact that every single thing that is wrong with ask 3 of my current diaper bags is fixed in this bag. That said,,,,,
The phone charger is really awesome and unique. For everyday use though I love the changing pod and how it fits in the diaper bag and folds right out so easily. I also love the magnetic key spot because I am always digging through my bag looking for my keys because they don't have a spot made for them. I am also super excited about the matching wallet!,,,,,
This bag!!! Oh my goodness! So momma-friendly and even for people without kids! It can be used for years and years! Good for taking things to work,,,,,
I love the sleek design and how it expands for extra space. It's neat that the backpack straps tuck in. The magnetic key FOB is key 😉 because I always lose my keys in the bag. I like that it's a modular design so things are easy to find and everything has a place plus extra room for all your items from baby (cloth or paper diaper) to toddler,,,,,
I have so many favorite features: Built in phone charger - this is unheard of and a must for our on-the-go life! The key fob/magnet combo for easy to find keys. I always spend 5 minutes digging for my keys when we leave anywhere. The fact that every inch of this bag has a specific purpose and yet is still versatile enough to meet the needs of so many people! Kickstand expansion for those days when you end up with more than you left the house with. Backpack straps and a quick grab handle and shoulder bag option. MATCHING WALLET! I could go on and on...,,,,,
The changing pod is going to be AMAZING!!! I'm so excited to have something small and compact that I can pop in and out of the restroom/changing room with. I'll be able to just take it out of the diaper bag and throw it into our gym bag or beach bag,,,,,
The organization component of this bag is what draws me to it. I lose my wallet and keys multiple times a day. Have a place that isn't just a black hole but an actual safe bag with a designated spot for my Keyes and wallet is amazing. Also the fact that it charges my phone is priceless. I'm always caught without my charger and at 1% battery. It's as if this bag was made for me.,,,,,
The way everything is compartmentalized and within easy reach!!! I love having a portable pod that I can use separately and also fits inside! I love that I have a charger for my phone because endless scrolling through Facebook while nursing definitely drains it! I love that it will be made with great quality,,,,,
I am excited about the whole bag! The phone charger,,,,,
The entire concept is amazing. Pockets with a purpose,,,,,
I'm obsessed with the pod! So handy and can be used in so many different ways.,,,,,
I don't think a top zipper is a possibility,,,,,
Sorry guys,,,,,
A little louder 😜-Sabrina,,,,,

Great job Delaney!,,,,,
"13"" laptop!",,,,,
Thanks,,,,,
Hi Kim-sabrina,,,,,
💜💜💜💜💜💜,,,,,
Aurbree you can add to your pledge to add wipes later with add-ons,,,,,
Will there be a way to loop it through the handle on a rolling suitcase? I know some Vera Bradly bags have it and it makes it so convenient when traveling because it can just sit on the suitcase,,,,,
Please,,,,,
Is there a way to lock the flap?  I'm thinking while traveling in the airport in backpack mode it'd be so easy to pull the flap up and grab things.....,,,,,
Would a top zipper be considered? Or an access point without having to open the flap?,,,,,
Is the changing pad in the pod able to snap into the bag as well incase one is dirty or you just need to replace it?,,,,,
Ideally would you hold most your diapers in the pod?,,,,,
So to confirm,,,,,
Has there been any further consideration to have a cross body strap for the diaper pod?,,,,,
Tami Stamper Davis you should share this video with your million friends! I keep sharing,,,,,
Favi Guzman-Pethel si lo compartes y vas al otro post puedes ganar un pañal!,,,,,
We both need this bag Dania Hujaij I love that it doesn't look like a diaper bag! And has all of that storage space!!,,,,,
Like every problem I've Ever had with a diaper bag is solved by this one 😂😂 I love the stoppers to make it stand upright. And the see through pockets for baby stuff. And the key fob/pocket because I am always losing mine.,,,,,
The wallet you can get to match the bag is my favorite feature not shown. I have a thing for matching wallets & bags. 😄,,,,,
Olivia Marie Morrison this bag looks awesome. I can't wait to get mine in December! It seriously charges your phone!!,,,,,
Richard H Johnston this is the answer to our cloth diaper nightmare of trying to find the perfect diaper bag.,,,,,
The cooler,,,,,
I think this would be great for you Renee Grace Alves,,,,,
"I'd also love to see the strap options in action. Maybe a shamwow-esque ""look how easy it wipes clean!""",,,,,
This would be perfect for you Bailey Alicia Craft,,,,,
Faye Legner,,,,,
Pockets! I love how they have a purpose and how it's a light interior so you can see where everything is!,,,,,
...And the size (it's perfect for us!👍) and the charger and the key fob (because both cute and practical!🤷‍♀️),,,,,
Charger! Key fob,,,,,
I love the fact that you can change from messenger,,,,,
Back pack straps and a cooler. Or as Wyatt would say is pack back straps lol,,,,,
Aurelia Greene I think you totally need a bag that charges your phone and has a magnetic key pocket so you'll never lose them lol,,,,,
Felicia Boudinot Fussner Noelle McLaughlin Kayla Hook u all need this diaper bag go back Hie on Kickstart. HIE is the Cadillac of all diaper bags and every kind of parent needs one.,,,,,
Fits your breast pump!!!! Puts chilled milk in the insulated cooler 😍😍,,,,,
Kristin Taylor this company makes the best cloth diapers. If you are looking for a diaper bag,,,,,
Amy Soubannarath I can't wait for this new diaper bag. It'll make traveling to see you guys so much easier!,,,,,
Jamie Wallace,,,,,
Brittany Bouyer-Chisholm with all the traveling and cruising you do,,,,,
Katie you may be a mommy who appreciates a diaper bag geek out...,,,,,
Shared publicly!!,,,,,
😍😍😍 you mean the HIElights,,,,,
I need this for my trip at the beginning of next month with the baby if you need a tester!! If not I guess I'll wait till it arrives in December.,,,,,
Christina Preciado,,,,,
Kerry A Kratzke  Mockups are up on the Kickstarter and you will be able to see it next week with Prototype #2,,,,,
Chat Night will also be covering this stuff tomorrow night! Woot!! -Laura,,,,,
@Nicole Dillon there's a mock-up in the Update! Prototype 2 will be ready to show next week.,,,,,
I'm literally taking it with me to the Oregon coast and will be going LIVE from Cannon Beach!!,,,,,
Yes! We want to be confident that YOU are confident in how Kickstarter works and now how Add-Ons work! -Laura,,,,,
It sits in your account and when you go to fill out your survey,,,,,
NO EXTRA SHIPPING FOR ADD-ONS! Think of it as a gift!! -Laura,,,,,
OR if we don't reach the Stretch Goal,,,,,

Carmine and Oxford are Kickstarter Exclusives!,,,,,
*35 ;),,,,,
Leeeeeet's get to $550k!,,,,,
LOL ~Kim  We'll get you a new one!,,,,,
@Sarah,,,,,
Yes,,,,,
Security was a breeze with Hie (Joey charger/battery included)!,,,,,
Are you at all considering metal clips for the straps,,,,,
Also.... 'bout those fabric samples...,,,,,
I never back this because I didn't think I needed one!!!! But now I'm in love!!!!! 😍 Over and out may day,,,,,
Yay love it! Can't wait to pack mine up and carry it everywhere with me! Super happy to see it has feet too!,,,,,
"Question- I know the finished bag is going to be smaller. How much smaller? Only a 1/2 inch off the depth? Because I'm only 5'1"" and I'm now worried that this is going to look ridiculously huge on me! 😬",,,,,
Love the backpack straps! Wish the shoulder strap looked a little more high end - metal claps instead of plastic buckles,,,,,
Oh gosh do not do not DO NOT go with a fixed shoulder pad. What a way to ruin a product.,,,,,
If you do go with a fixed/padded strap,,,,,
Is that going to be the inside liner color on that!? I like it so much better than the blue!,,,,,
This is still bigger than the finished product? I know that you said in the first video the #1 pro type was bigger. Wasn't sure if this one is true to size of that will come or will be smaller. Thanks!,,,,,
At our gate charging Hie before boarding.,,,,,
Please tell me the front snap is more then just magnetic😬,,,,,
Wow!!! I actually LOVE all of the changes! The backpack strap feature is so cool and honestly it doesn't really look THAT big,,,,,
Looks like it's going to be awesome! I like the sliding padding on the shoulder strap,,,,,
Love it!!! I've never tried the backpack option for a bag except my school bag and those older hurt my shoulders but the construction on this looks amazing so I think it will provide better support I'm excited and the cross body option and gripper sold me as well,,,,,
This is looking incredible! Loving the back pack straps. My favorite part is that you can change between backpack carry and messenger carry without having to change which way the bag goes. I currently have a Diaper Dude bag and you have to change which way the bag itself goes. So annoying.,,,,,
This looks to be my favorite bag ever and I'm not a bag person. It just seems so practical and I love that it's structured!,,,,,
Amazing.. love watching the updates and the bag gets better every time!!,,,,,
Hit it out of the park immediately! I think they look incredibly functional. I'll be following along to see how they work for your trip,,,,,
Love this! I love that there are backpack straps as well as a shoulder strap. I typically carry my babies on my back,,,,,
Kayla Schadegg Ella just said this was a video of you 😀,,,,,
My favorite yet! This fixes like all the other issues I had with my very expensive PPB bag! (That I just sold- sorry mama :( ) to add though. The shoulder strap on my PPB bag was a slickly material and it made it very difficult to adjust the shoulder strap and for it to STAY! Drove me crazy (just a 'tid bit of info there),,,,,
Sliding shoulder pad please! When its fixed both sides have to be adjusted for it to be centeted. I make small adjustments all the time and big ones if husband is carrying.  Also plentt padded because diaper bags get heavy lol,,,,,
This has me soooo excited!!! 😍😍,,,,,
Yes,,,,,
No,,,,,
No,,,,,
Will this fit under strollers or do you have to clip it on the back? We live in the city so we have a petite stroller (mountain buggy nano),,,,,
Is there any place someone could hook a carbinger on to? I have my keys on a carbinger and usually put it on my belt loop,,,,,
So if there aren't stroller straps,,,,,
Can there be a flap over the hole for the wipes so it covers cloth wipes when the pod is out?,,,,,
I love Grovia wipes! Will there be a flap to keep that first wipe clean? Especially when you take only the pod.,,,,,
What can I do to help market the kickstarter? I've been sharing like crazy.,,,,,
Will you guys post size dimensions? I just want the pod but not sure if it's too big for us or not lol,,,,,
Is this the bag with the preorder,,,,,
Could the pod possibly have a water bottle pouch on the side when its being used on a stroller?,,,,,
Is that cooler bag coming with the kickstarter? Or is that additional purchase?,,,,,
Will the magnetic features be an issue for airport security?,,,,,
How large is the water bottle pouch? Would the purrrfect water bottle size fit,,,,,
Will pods be available by themselves after the kickstarter?,,,,,
I had heard talk about the possibility of a backpack carry. Is this true?,,,,,
Could the diaper pod have an attachable shoulder strap? will it have a place to attach one?,,,,,
Kim you look so great! Tell me all of your secrets for having 6 kids and looking like that!! Sabrina beautiful as always 😍,,,,,
Can we see what the changing pad in the removable pod looks like,,,,,
I'd rather store them wet in a reusable wipe container because you can store more of them for less room.,,,,,
I can't wait for this! My daughter is a gtube baby! And we have to carry so many emergency supplies,,,,,
Is there Velcro on the front of the bag,,,,,
This video demo really has swayed me. I am still a little hesitant to back,,,,,
The food pouch will come with the complete bag?,,,,,
They way these mom care for their GroVia diapers,,,,,
Yes we are! <3 It's the best kind of exhilarating!! -Laura,,,,,
Food pod stuff,,,,,
Little bit of Rose and Abalone going on with those pillows. ;) -Laura,,,,,
#apeonyforyourthoughts -Laura,,,,,
Yay Carmine!-Sabrina,,,,,
Its so exciting hearing what is coming up-sabrina,,,,,
Betsy is telling you,,,,,
You guys looks gorgeous-Sabrina,,,,,
We love it,,,,,
Love watching you live 💜💜,,,,,
It's soooooooooooooooooooooo good. -Laura,,,,,
Hey!!,,,,,
Hie!!! <3 -Laura,,,,,
Thanks,,,,,
We're getting a lot of questions on Kickstarter about the food pod and place for water bottle! -Laura,,,,,
I backed the pod,,,,,
Will the tablet pocket fit a MacBook? Is it padded? Would it be a water proof material in case something were to leak near the electronics?,,,,,
I had a question about cleaning - I know its not machine washable but does it have anything to protect? im terrified going light but the colors are just so perfect!,,,,,
Will it make a great purse or toddler bag? Brooke is 2.5 and about to potty learn. I've already backed for $250 but want to make sure it will work for longer than diaper days.,,,,,
>I< really want Peony too!,,,,,
Can the laptop pouch fit an ezpz mat?,,,,,
Will the next backer reward benefit all tiers,,,,,
Joey is TSA approved correct?,,,,,
How many inches will it be across ?,,,,,
What was her goal? 😆,,,,,
Holland... please send out a baby chat video so my son can translate your knowledge on future stretch goals and rewards to me!,,,,,
Oh my! I can't even handle that. So. Adorable. 💙,,,,,

Update: Just launched on Kickstarter! There's a launch day special price 😀https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/914595512/soundbrake-20-the-awareness-device-for-headphones,,,,,
Hey everyone,,,,,
This device sounds like it would be absolutely amazing!  My daughter is hearing impaired and turns headphones all the way up to try and hear them and is COMPLETELY oblivious to the outside world when she does this.  This is a game changer!  She played on the 1st USA Women's Deaf National Hockey Team and I can speak on behalf of all her teammates that they would all LOVE this product!  So excited for its release to have her try it out!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,,,,,
Thank you for creating such a unobtrusive,,,,,
This literally sounds like they didn't make good sound proof headphones so they advertised them as the opposite lol,,,,,
An interesting idea. I am curious about the Battery: Why did you choose that type and how long does it last? is the device water proof? How much extra weight does it add to the line? Can it be used as a line mice for hands free calling?,,,,,
Great idea,,,,,
this is a great idea,,,,,
good idea,,,,,
Very innovative,,,,,
Awesome !!🤗,,,,,
this is genius,,,,,
Great sound and very innovative,,,,,

Can't stand a top sheet,,,,,
I love my top sheet. Sometimes it is too hot for the duvet; and studies have shown that it is not healthy to become overheated when you sleep. Also it means that the duvet cover does not need to be washed as often. 🙂🌿,,,,,
Def an absolute must! It protects your quilt cover from discoloration from the natural oils in your skin.,,,,,
I wish the sets would come with two flat sheets. The fitted never seems to fit properly.,,,,,
Love a top sheet...  Queensland er!,,,,,
I hate top sheets.. I'm in Queensland and in the summer I just use a duvet cover on top without the heavy inner part,,,,,

Nice work Tony!,,,,,
I would be interested in purchasing shorter videos for download on subjects such as which mediums and when and its immediate and long term effects. I would like videos regarding finishing (varnish or final care to paintings),,,,,
Is it downloadable or just streaming....because i dont have a stable internet so its much better for me to download it and watch it again and again,,,,,
Does this support googke wifi mesh?is the ethernet port regu,,,,,
It looks better than first box design.,,,,,
Too big for the small device inside! If you put a phone on it,,,,,
needs some simple descriptions of what it can do (but not specs),,,,,
What happens if one uses P2P ,,,,,
P2P are just flows; Firewalla will not impact performance.  The only minor impact is,,,,,

Amazing. I love that you can get lights and light it up at night.   Love it.,,,,,
Are you in the video. I can't tell anton,,,,,
Diana,,,,,
Fantastic video Anton! I'll hopefully see you at the OR this year,,,,,
Where is the first location in the video with the clear water and boulders?,,,,,
Kenneth Eng - That is Lake Tahoe,,,,,
Has anyone figured out a good solution for adding a paddle or fishing rod holder the their kayak?  I think this would be a logical addition to a future Oru Kayak product and could be a good retrofit to the existing one.,,,,,
Great video👍,,,,,
Kate Laugher check these out!,,,,,
Wow Laura they look amazing! I think I'd be too scared to go out in the dark tho haha!,,,,,
Just received my lamps today,,,,,
"That's what I'm talkin' about!  ""It's just magical"".",,,,,
Bill,,,,,
Awesome! My Oru Kayak arrived today! I was so anxious to put it together that I did it in my living room. Tomorrow morning is the first lake trial...can't wait!,,,,,
Very cool!  I was there that day!  Roberto is rocking it! Laurel,,,,,
The video came out spectacular! Glad we could help showcase your amazing kayaks!,,,,,
I'm going Flyfishing from mine tomorrow here in Puerto Rico. Love it.,,,,,
The lake looks beautiful and I am going to buy a OK!,,,,,
Margo Hall just sent you an email. Let's get your troubles sorted out. I am sure there is a solution.,,,,,
I estimate I paddled 9 miles in mine today,,,,,
Where can I demo one of these at Tahoe?,,,,,
I'll be ready to go next week in Boothbay Harbor,,,,,
Manish Thakran,,,,,
I am in Granite Bay,,,,,
Hi,,,,,
Allen Fourfivesix We will do another outreach post for people in FL soon.,,,,,
Cynde Jones Sign-up for our newsletter at the bottom of the homepage on http://www.orukayak.com/ to make sure you hear about our next Bay Area demos.,,,,,
Great to have a report of sustained service and usefulness by an Oru Kayak.   They are workers.   Let's hear it for durability!,,,,,
Wow. Impressive. We love ours. Vancouver pop up store at Kits Beach. Fri. June 27. 5-8. We will demo the Kayaks.  See you there,,,,,
I love my Oru Kayak. First used mine last winter in the Florida Keys paddling through the mangrove islands. Now using it in the beautiful lakes and rivers of my home state of Michigan.,,,,,
Pearl Mop,,,,,
"""can't sell directly in Vancouver"" meaning?  Vancouverites would need to ship to a US destination and pick up? or....?",,,,,
Hey Paul,,,,,
Good Job Colin & ORUKAYAK !,,,,,
Hello Oru Kayakers.  We were recently notified of a glitch in our Customer Support platform.  Unbeknownst to us,,,,,
Jamie Marie Migliore they make fold up kayaks,,,,,
That would be awesome. I would totally get one,,,,,
Amazing! Saw you guys on Shark Tank & I can't wait to try one out this summer and blog about it.... Will you guys be in Providence visiting Brown or Rhode Island School of Design  this summer? :-) --RC,,,,,
Great product..,,,,,
Yes! This is cool. Just what I have been waiting to see! Now,,,,,
Incredible!!!! Wishing you guys stellar success with this,,,,,
Benjamin Scott saw this thing on Shark Tank,,,,,
I was traveling when Oru Kayak was on Shark Tank. I just found it on Hulu Plus,,,,,
A demo by a skilled kayaker.,,,,,
I see how it handles well in the ocean.  Is the kayak also good for lake,,,,,
Oh,,,,,
Has anyone played around with alternative backpacking methods for their Oru Kayak?  I normally camp with a parachute hammock and could see using the tree straps to pack in the kayak.,,,,,
i guess you can say that was a rocky start.,,,,,
Please tell me the skirt that fits orukayak,,,,,
Is that advisable to launch from the rocks like that?,,,,,
S David Lawson we don not recommend launching this way. It is just to showcase the durability. We recommend that you treat the Oru Kayak like a fiber glass kayak to maximize its life.,,,,,
Takeaki Mafune https://orukayak.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201792304-Does-the-Oru-Kayak-fit-a-spray-skirt-,,,,,
I've used the Oru Kayak with a spray skirt many times. It's very easy to attach it.,,,,,
Yay,,,,,
Oru kayak is becoming my choice as soon as i can not carry my 70 pound  Ocean Kayak vessel. In my country is not sold yet.  But I have my eye on one.,,,,,
Well,,,,,
So awesome! I can't wait till I get one of my own,,,,,
Oh my god,,,,,

Super comfortable belts.,,,,,
Belts work good but break a day after the year warranty expires. The buckle is good but the leather falls apart because it has plastic inside of it,,,,,

Best belts ever.,,,,,
I love mine!,,,,,
Love mine ....,,,,,
This belt arrived fast as well very sturdy well made purchase x3 gun buckle & black reinforced belt set. Looks great as wearing with a pair of dress pants or with jeans. Perfect for my fire arm too. Scissors don't cut it down to size. Had to use my razor knife and slice the back as well to the front. I highly recommend it for anyone concealing,,,,,
I backed them on Kickstarter. Love this belt. Great quality. Works really well.,,,,,
Best belt I've ever owned,,,,,
Love my reinforced belt,,,,,
Great belt. I have 2. I wear them daily.,,,,,
You forgot to mention how much,,,,,
Now live on Kickstarter >> http://kck.st/2bApa2o,,,,,
I backed the Trakline Express belt (3 belts + 3 buckles) and received them almost two weeks ago. They are awesome. Is the X3 belt/buckle compatible with the Trakline Express belt/buckle?,,,,,
Looks like a great edc belt going to have to buy one soon,,,,,
Do you guys carry size 44,,,,,
If I order today when should I expect to see it in the mail?  Thanks,,,,,
How much for the kick starter belt?,,,,,
"I own the X2 version of this and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a strong and sturdy belt. The ratchet system is super easy to use and having the additional adjustments over a normal belt is convenient when trying to find that ""sweet spot"".  Especially when using for concealed carry. Way to go Kore Essentials",,,,,
Finally picked a x2 up.  Been debating on it for over a year to get one. I love it. Wish I had done it earlier,,,,,
Ordered 2 belts with Buckles on Sat. Cant wait to get them...,,,,,

I don't really know how it works in Japan but she isn't doing anything with companies so it's more difficult,,,,,
Well,,,,,
I find it funny that at the live there's about 20 people and the the stream is about average 12 person do it's about a third,,,,,
I love that person to keep her calm and to keep a conversation going,,,,,
As long as she keeps playing live and rehearsaling she'll earn it. She already has it. :),,,,,

Tijuana,,,,,
Is this her first performance on stage? She's great,,,,,
The reason why she go back it's because of financial reasons,,,,,
She just need to relax and she'll be ok,,,,,
She has a good conection with her public,,,,,

Jim O'Brien. ... have you ever seen this guy? He's from Nashville area?,,,,,
Hands down my favourite has to be the one where you grab a guitar and make beautiful auditory art,,,,,
For me they are all awesome but if I had to pick one “ Bootleg Turn “  OMG or “Abracadabra “ There are so many missing  Man you are the best just awesome 👏  🤘🥃🥃🤘🎸,,,,,
Abracadabra  Because (although it’s a tough decision) If Walls Could Talk is my favorite of the albums.,,,,,
Dude they are all the shit that's like trying to ask a honey bear what kind of particular honey he likes I like them all LOL,,,,,
It's impossible ! It's impossible to have a favourite but darn look at those fingers go !!!!!!,,,,,

After meeting you at the gutiar show in Springfield Missouri I knew I wanted to build guitars like you play. Well one year later and I have completed a couple projects and tonight I just finished my first ioring board lap steel.  As well my guitar playing skill has increased significantly after sitting through your guitar shop talk. I know this is kind of strange and probably won't really reach you but I just had to try to thank you in some way for all the positive ways you improved my life.  You truly rock justin!,,,,,

Oh my gosh Marc this is brilliant!! I’ve just purchased it! Keep rocking man and head off to South Africa please!,,,,,
Sitting at my window in WI,,,,,
I love this song with your performance👌,,,,,
I really enjoyed your take on this song. Very few people have the range to sing this song and you hit it right out of the park.,,,,,
My friend Marc Martel,,,,,
I really enjoy the horns and your vocals are awesome but I wasn't really a fan of the electric tom clap sounds that come in and out at times. I felt like it cluttered up what in essence is supposed to feel really simple but beyond that I enjoyed your take on the song and another great song to imagine Freddie Singing.,,,,,
Ahh vc é demais 😍🎤🎶,,,,,
Facebook audio compression = 😒 Really makes me appreciate the full sounding recording! ❤️ And this is such a fun song! Well done sir! 😁,,,,,
"Make sure you sing ""Las Palabras de Amor"" by Queen when you tour South America. Just a friendly advice ;)",,,,,
Absolute love this Marc,,,,,

Felicitaciones marc eres fantastic!,,,,,
**Read this if you bought tickets via PayPal ** If like myself any of you have ordered tickets via PayPal for the UK tour on the fact that Marc Martel was going to be fronting them and feel cheated by the change and want a refund raise a dispute on the PayPal site with the ticket agent and you should get a full refund. I've just got my £109 back. Everything to gain and nothing to lose unless yr happy with the change.,,,,,
Perfeito ,,,,,
grandeeeeee,,,,,
Better than Adam Lambert,,,,,
Marc Martel  ainda irei conhecer você!,,,,,

Awww!!! It's awsome!!! :),,,,,
Great! 👍,,,,,
Wonderful voice,,,,,
Marc Martel,,,,,
Wow. So cool to see snippets of working out the arrangement from piano to the day of recording.  Were you able to hear the string arrangement before recording your vocals for this song? I imagine that was a big deal to record together that day.,,,,,

Marc Martel!!! Menino  da garganta de ouro!!!!,,,,,
I got volume 1 today!!!,,,,,
Wow!!! Excellent!! :),,,,,
Come to Oporto.,,,,,
"Thanks again Marc Martel for sharing the stories behind your song selections for this EP! It's a lot of fun learning more about the production and recording process involved to getting your music to our ears.  Did you have any particular challenges with this or any other song that you recorded (or didn't finish recording) for the final EP that you can share? Getting the vocal performance right for ""Take On Me"" definitely seems like a challenge for the average singer! :)",,,,,
""" Take on Me"" is one of my favorite 80's songs. Those were my high school years",,,,,
Soy tu admiradora ,,,,,
Wow!! Exciting for sure!!!!!   Way to keep us tuned in and jumping with anticipation Marc!!!   ❤️👍🏼😁,,,,,
MARC you deserve the BEST in the world,,,,,
from the small(very small)snippet we heard.sounds good😀,,,,,
Sua voz é  esplêndido!!!,,,,,
Omg,,,,,
For a minute there I thought you meant London 🇬🇧  You must be due a visit and a few concerts..... there’s a few good people waiting to see you perform.... here’s hoping 🤞🏻👍🏻😃,,,,,
Beat drums!  Hope it's been a good day to rest your voice before you put it to good use in the studio. Hope we don't have too much longer to wait to hear the finished product after all that time you've spent recording over there!,,,,,
Here's my electronic kit. Get the V-drums with the TD-30 brain.,,,,,
BoRhap going well? Can't wait to hear you in it!,,,,,
I would be ecstatic if I could play one instrument proficiently!   Keep banging that drum 'til you become it.  It can certainly save a lot of money if you can play all the instruments on your own songs.  :),,,,,
'76 was a great year. It gave you to the world! Love you!,,,,,
Surprises in London ... really connecting well !!! London,,,,,
Give some singing classes to Tyler in exchange for drums lessons! Seeing you together again would be great! 🇧🇷,,,,,
Happy to hear you had some down time. Sometimes we need to decompress by ourselves. Nice kicks. Montreal my hometown. I miss it so. Freddie was there in 81. Have fun recording. I am anxious to hear what it is. I presume you are at Abbey Road studios. Enjoy the rest of your time in London. I loved it there. 🇨🇦🇺🇸🇬🇧,,,,,
Soooooooooooooo HANSOME,,,,,
Montreal '76,,,,,
Tu admiradora siempre y de tu música ,,,,,
You remind me of me!! 🤣If I'm not strumming or keyboarding ... I'm drumming!! 👍🏼😊😁 life is good!!   Love Canada!! Nice shoes 😍,,,,,

Simply amazing ❤️,,,,,
Love this !!,,,,,
I;'m so bummed that I missed this show!!!,,,,,
I think you are great😍,,,,,
See..... THIS GUY is why hundreds of UK fans are disappointed with the Queen Extravaganza. They kept silent as they replaced Marc - the only true heir to the Queen throne.,,,,,
Keep making a convincing case for me to travel 1000 miles to catch a live performance of yours,,,,,
Crystal should shoot all your videos .. that's something special as you look and smile discreetly.😊  You only do that when Crystal is behind the camera 😍  I love it.,,,,,
Marc,,,,,
Did you think you could sound anything but awesome doing your sound check?! It wouldn't matter if the piano was way out of tune,,,,,
BRO. When do US tix go on sale?,,,,,
Experience the Extraordinary!,,,,,
Fantastic Marc...Keep them coming. Some people just HAVE THE GIFT.....,,,,,

Kbcu radio waiting for another single from you marc,,,,,
Marc mi fai sognare e rilassare,,,,,
Brilliant!,,,,,
we all sang the backing vocals as we watched. i’m sure of it.,,,,,
Dude! Is there anything you can’t sing as good,,,,,
Joey Tempest is going to be mad that you sing it better than he does! 😀,,,,,
Well you could just sing the phone book and it’d sound dandy wouldn’t it.,,,,,
LOL! Fantastic! Sounds just like him. How about taking a stab at “Carrie”?,,,,,
It's just amazing your vocal range. and that's because you had the flu. I am happy and grateful to God for living at the same time as you to enjoy your great talent. as I said before,,,,,
As always,,,,,
I feel so fortunate that I saw you with the Black Jacket Symphony and that made me be a huge fan! Also,,,,,
I burn up more of my very limited data listening/watching you than on anything else,,,,,
So,,,,,
Seriously,,,,,
"There's a new covers album. ""Freddie Mercury"" sings certain classic rock hits lol. That would be cool. Similar to Jimmy ""Orion"" Ellis recording Crazy Little Thing Called Love as if Elvis had recorded it.",,,,,
No need for autotune with that voice,,,,,
Again? Again? You make me think: why God,,,,,
Honestly,,,,,
I am never disappointed when I listen to you sing.  No mater what you sing. Thank you for giving us such joy.  See you March 3!!!,,,,,
God blessed you with such an amazing gift! I'm so glad I was introduced to your amazing talent via the QE audition video. I believe great things are in store for you. Congratulations on this milestone! ❤,,,,,
And you still sound just like Freddie!😂🙌🏻 Hopefully I’ll get to see a show within driving distance of Nashville that doesn’t get canceled. ❤️,,,,,
Awesome.  Congratulations.  Such a wonderful talent. Enjoy everything I hear you do.  I,,,,,
Everytime I am not in a singing mood...I just need to listen to you for a couple of minutes and that's it...after that I've got to sing!! Inspiring!!!,,,,,
YOU ROCK!!!!!  You are awesome!!  Your voice!  Your talent!!  Your face!! <3,,,,,
"Well deserved.  You crack me up with the ""mouth keyboard"".  Glad to see you've survived the flu.",,,,,
Sensacional Marc! Sou muito seu fã!!! E tento acompanhar sempre seus trabalhos!! Existe a possibilidade de vir tocar no Brasil???,,,,,
"Couldn't have listened to the whole thing without the ""bah-bah-baaah-bah's!"" Loved it! Congrats on feeling better and the 100",,,,,
Great❤❤❤❤❤❤ it s amazing wow!!!! Europe😍,,,,,
Spent my Sunday crying. Had to put Jake down Thursday morning. He had a stroke Wednesday night. My poor boy would have been 16 on may 10th. Best Treeing Walker Coonhound ever :( sorry buddy I miss you,,,,,
Are you still gonna tour with QuEx next year?,,,,,
Slow down... you move too  fast🎵🎵you got to make the morning last🎶🎶🎶,,,,,

A photographer that can COOK! Multiple gifts... typical Martel.,,,,,
In my opinion you are the best voice for any song. Good luck from Brazil.  Maybe now you can come to Brazil.,,,,,
Today I am getting ready    for spring here in beautiful sunny south Texas. Painted benches for my flower pots and bird feeder for the birds.,,,,,
My husband loves Asian food! How about posting the recipe for that shrimp. Sounds delicious!,,,,,
I made food for the week,,,,,
Gutted man now you won’t be leading queen in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ave asked for money back on tickets,,,,,
"Hey Marc.  Any chance you could Mercurize some other songs.  I love hearing you sing Queen songs but it would so be great to hear other songs  ""a la Freddy"".  I can't tell you how excited I was to hear carols sung like Freddy.  Its like he's alive  singing stuff other than Queen.  I would deffo buy that album.  ps.  You are amazing.",,,,,
Can't wait to hear your future recordings! Love you!,,,,,
Keep recording...we love listening!,,,,,
I was so curious what is coming ... and what came? I got hungry.😀 Where can I get shrimp at midnight?  🤔,,,,,
The ending looked like Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer :),,,,,
❤️,,,,,
Yardwork on this beautiful sunny day. Cleaned up the mess from the winter freeze.,,,,,
I'm super proud of you,,,,,
Praise Jesus,,,,,

MARY DID YOU KNOW,,,,,
Carol of the Bells... maybe go a bit more rock than choral with the arrangement?,,,,,
Oh yes definitely Mary did you know ❤,,,,,
Mary did you know....beautiful song,,,,,
There's a song on one of Amy Grants Christmas LPs,,,,,
A Winter's Tale    Queen.,,,,,
Marc I would be very happy if you could sing this Italian Christmas song,,,,,
"Id like another original or so. You write great originals.   Did you ever think of doing Thank God It's Christmas by Queen?   Something lesser done. Too many Xmas songs done by everyone and some get overlooked. Maybe cover some originals from CCM artists like ""Christmas is all in the Heart"" by Steven Curtis Chapman or some of the originals from your other Klove tourmates.",,,,,
All I Want for Christmas is You Thank God It's Christmas White Christmas,,,,,
Thank God It’s Christmas  Queen,,,,,
We three kings...but with a kind of marching beat arrangement. And some insane harmonies on star of wonder etc.,,,,,
Caroling Caroling by Nat King Cole O Little Town of Bethlehem  The Magic of Christmas (God Bless Us Everyone) by Celine Dion,,,,,

Little Drummer Boy.  Old Toy Trains. Brahms Bethlehem Lullaby.,,,,,
I’d love to hear your spin on White Christmas or Winter Wonderland!,,,,,

Wonderful,,,,,
Whew! the radio silence was making me nervous,,,,,
👊🏻.   Heck yeah!!,,,,,
Saw on IG that they are shipping. Will I receive a tracking number? #36 so hoping I made the first batch!,,,,,
Just got my shipping notice- stoked to take it on Trip to Texas next week,,,,,
Just got my tracking number!,,,,,
Just got my tracking number also!,,,,,
Could it be? It’s real? It’s on its way? Just a couple of days away!,,,,,
Mine arriving tomorrow!,,,,,
First said to be delivered on Sat,,,,,
I haven't been keeping up through the initial delays. Is the 30 shipping too? I think it's time.,,,,,
lazar cut?,,,,,
In for patches whenever they are out!,,,,,
On top of North Bowl?,,,,,
I saw mine!!,,,,,
Great looking packs!,,,,,
"You misspelled ""Christmas"".",,,,,
Yaussss!,,,,,
"Any idea when the ""super early reserve"" might be shipping?",,,,,
As soon as they get stateside. I’ll keep updating as I get a firmer date. Thank you for your patience. Fingers crossed no hold ups as they cross the pond.,,,,,
Did the field grey go through or the black only?  I remember at one point there was an option or that an option could exist?  TBH I forgot what I ordered and what was available!,,,,,
I can’t wait to check out the final product!,,,,,
Dial it in and lock it down.,,,,,
👍,,,,,
Is the clipiter available as an add-on for the KS?,,,,,
Haha! Nice to hear your voice Jack!,,,,,
Clippiter check. Safety glasses check. ANSI certified Safety shoes check. Safety gloves.... not check:(,,,,,
Always one for adventure... proud of you,,,,,
YKK zippers and and low pro custom nylon web pulls.  hardware is durafelx across the board.,,,,,
will get to that Coco.  hold tight .  but yes.,,,,,
Haha thanks Andrew!,,,,,
Thank you David!!,,,,,
ok fixed the phone rodel,,,,,
Padded on all sides.,,,,,
yes,,,,,
Love the volume on the interior sections.,,,,,
Do I just put my credit card info in right here?,,,,,
Even though it doesn't have waterproof zippers,,,,,
OK,,,,,
Thanks guys. Dropping off,,,,,
I think you guys said you weren't putting any internal pockets or whatnot in the different sections - is that still true?,,,,,
Can you comment on the hardware? Are the  zippers YKK or the buckles ITW and are they replaceable?,,,,,
That clip positioning will remedy the water bottle thing for me. Thumbs up.,,,,,
Does the CPL24 hold its shape when empty? Can you show it without anything inside?,,,,,
I gotcha. I definitely prefer the streamlined look. Thanks guys!,,,,,
ahahaha Coco and I jumped on the same thing :-),,,,,
What colors will be available during launch?,,,,,
I think it cut out or was that the end lol,,,,,
exactly what I meant,,,,,
Do you guys have any warranty info yet?,,,,,
You guys are good. Got sound and the video got better.,,,,,
LOL,,,,,
What's the length on the MPL30?,,,,,
lorelli coming up.  This is our mountain bag.  houses a lap top but that is not its main purpose.  the city bag or CPL24 in the prior video below has a much more padded compartment.  but stand by for how it works.,,,,,
Justin it goes live on july 11th and we will certainly post that link.,,,,,
july 11th,,,,,
join us over here now,,,,,
Apologies if I missed any questions.  First time using FB live,,,,,
Weight? and is it possible to buy outside of kickstarter?,,,,,
What's the plan for international shipping - company of choice?,,,,,
Will all three colorways be available July 11th?,,,,,
Will both packs come with sternum straps?,,,,,
I may have missed this,,,,,
Will you post a link for the kickstarter ?,,,,,
Gotcha! Thanks,,,,,
Is there a frame sheet in the back?,,,,,
Are the buckles/hardware ITW?,,,,,
User replaceable hardware? ( Buckles )   Warranty plan?,,,,,
Nathaniel Woods,,,,,

Lock your phone display- then rotate,,,,,
Any accompanying accessories planned for launch?,,,,,
Will this newsletter contain a Kickstarter live date? 😃😃,,,,,
You gonna open that or are we to just take your word that your contents are dry?  😈.   No aquaseal zips huh?,,,,,
Same here 😎. Can't wait to get to use your packs!,,,,,
Is that a tan colored pack?  Any plans for tan/brown exteriors in the lineup?  Looking good!,,,,,
Amy Reichert....a smaller one,,,,,
Oh baby that is one sexy piece of equipment. Must have.,,,,,
Is there an easy way to secure the waistbelt out of the way when not carrying heavy loads? I appreciate the waistbelt when the load is heavy but I like being able to tuck it away or remove it all together when not needed.,,,,,
Jack where do you think your price point for it will be?,,,,,
"Very cool.  Love the panel load.  I'm trying to pinpoint the Field Grey.  Wolf Grey is too ""blue"" or bright for my liking.  Foliage Green is decent enough.  Is the Field Grey darker or more ""grey"" than the wolf or foliage?  Also",,,,,
Killin' it with the color combinations. You're really making it tough on us when it comes time to choose our packs.,,,,,
Looks nice,,,,,
Sweet looking bag Jack Barley!,,,,,
that's black ya'll,,,,,
Yes!  That's awesome.  Even that subtle contrast makes it easier to see stuff and adds a bit more of a properly finished look.,,,,,
TAKE. MY. MONEY,,,,,
Sigh,,,,,
Super excited about this :D Really dig the grey inside.,,,,,
Looks fantastic!,,,,,
yeah so let me know if you need someone to test one in the Seattle rain :D,,,,,

I am currently writing a physical letter and I know where the beasts of balance makerversity vault is. It is listed in the New Scientist 2017 show guide,,,,,
This looks great! Can you use all the beasts in the orginal game mode or keep parts and games seperate?,,,,,
Hey saw the omnibeast has a card will this be available if you have already purchased him previously?,,,,,
Hey guys.. I know there was quite a lot of talk in the Kickstarter comments at some point about proper packaging for this expansion and more importantly the cards to keep them from getting damaged... any update on this?,,,,,
My game arrives today and I already preordered.,,,,,
Really cool,,,,,
So is this a whole game,,,,,
Are new playing modes going to be released in the app?,,,,,

Love my Shiver Shield,,,,,
Those will be great for our cold weather hunting up here in Michigan,,,,,

Major marketing fail when you spend more time talking about why your competitor is bad instead of why you are good.  A genuine,,,,,
Cant u set the same route or way-point for the mavic pro? U should have not set the course for the airdog if u want it to be fair.. or set the route for mavic.. re-test ..,,,,,
Biased review,,,,,
Airdog i havent hear this brand. Any thought about it?!,,,,,
Bobby Joe Casey,,,,,
So you active track not way point on the mavic ... not really a fair comparison is it ...   Does the dog thing even have active track ?   Very bias test ... do a proper comparison but guess you won't as mavic is far more advanced,,,,,
What happend to way point on Mavic? I guess nobody  explain to you how to use it,,,,,
Looks great. But so did the Lily.    I'll believe it when these are out in the wild and getting great reviews from real users.    Until then it's another Lily or 3DR Solo that promised everything and delivered nothing.   If your totally happy with it being the best,,,,,
I'm not really a fan of,,,,,
What about the GPS based follow mode? I think it would be the better alternative in a track like this,,,,,
Am looking for something that would follow me on a trail,,,,,
I have no issues with it following me on open terrain. The Mavic Pro will hold its reign over airdog and all other similar drones. DJI has far more experience in the drone department and if proper updating is done,,,,,
Is it possible to do height in the predefined route now...?,,,,,
When will this be available at Walmart?,,,,,
Take a look Jamie how this guy is struggling with its tracking features. This Airdog drone tracking feature seems to be reliable compare to a Mavic,,,,,
Dig it. Clearly the predefined route functionality is premium to the mavic follow-me. The mavic presets are very limited.,,,,,
Great review! ... marketing blabla put to the test :),,,,,
Seems like a fair review.,,,,,

"May I ask why this project finds it appropriate to use the name ""Manifest Destiny"" and claim to be critical of the genocide and imperialism that accompanied that concept in American History",,,,,
"By ""outlaw attitude"" do you mean totally normative white imperialism? Plenty of those ""outlaws"" were scalping unarmed women and children for government money — totally within the bounds of the law. #LANDMD",,,,,

Yup I’ll have one thanks 🙏,,,,,
Double or single vented? I bet it's single and probably has cuffs lol,,,,,
These supposedly started shipping in january.  However there isn't a single review video online of someone actually receiving one.  Sketchy...,,,,,
Maybe more money on manufacturing/shipping instead of marketing and social media? We still don't have a shipping date.,,,,,
Jude Collins,,,,,
Is there a product?,,,,,
I was told mine shipped a month ago.... no tracking number.... still no product.... now their site is down.... losing hope,,,,,
Way Chang,,,,,
Sickkk I want one 😮,,,,,
Really cool. Congrats for the whole advertising. It's dynamic,,,,,
Where are the sizes!?!?! Why can’t anyone answer me!!! I want to buy a suit that fits... or is it a one size fits all suit!?,,,,,
Indiegogo link appears broken on my phone... Wonder if it works elsewhere? Either way,,,,,

Hi all,,,,,
Tip: The light should be just thin circle not so big. It is now too eye irritating.,,,,,
In spite of the issues,,,,,
I thought the live stream will start later so I didn't saw it since the beginning. Is there any video file to see the transfer speed?,,,,,
Indeed not stable but it's promising given that the basic idea is functional. Please,,,,,
Guys what is the production schedule? When yo expect to have the final adapter ready in order to be ready for mass production?,,,,,
Very nice design - to gain credibility I would suggest to ask a known (and trusted) Tech / Mac Magazin to check out and test the final prototype. This should give the community the confidence they are looking for.,,,,,
Maybe try a different hdmi cable?,,,,,
Can you try to rip out the cable? :),,,,,
To show how it detached in a tricky situation.,,,,,
Only 7 people live stream?,,,,,
looking forward!!,,,,,
not stable 😩,,,,,
Onde posso comprar este adaptador magsafe?,,,,,
Still no response.,,,,,
Connector too thick ,,,,,
Try re-connecting the HDMI cable after the MagC is connected to the MacBook,,,,,
Ease connection. 👍,,,,,
Hola!,,,,,
Tim Cook did...,,,,,
Yes,,,,,
happened to my asus.....,,,,,
What a terrible incident! Can anyone provide me a solution if I buy a MBP without MagSafe?  How can I get my MBP protected?,,,,,

Can you tell me how much does it cost ?,,,,,
Is this still available for purchase?,,,,,
Is it on sale in US?,,,,,
My husband & his family speak Cantonese. It's been a stiff learning curve for me. We are due with our first child soon and I have been searching for teaching items. I do wish someone would come out with a similar product to this just in Cantonese. ❤,,,,,
Is this is available in Pakistan i wants to get it,,,,,
Hi Chineasy,,,,,

Dear friends,,,,,
I am pleased to announce that the winner,,,,,
The Fantastic Flying Books is such a beautiful short. 😭,,,,,
Greatpost thanks  really love,,,,,
Thats why i like  animation. Looks like it's not a serious media,,,,,
This is wonderful. When my own short was used by UNICEF to promote better methods of communication with children (especially those affected by bullying) worldwide,,,,,
Animation has always been a strong part of my growing up,,,,,
I've really enjoyed in current animation,,,,,
animation is such a powerful medium!,,,,,
a great moment there - yes,,,,,
The impact of animation on people is timeless,,,,,
this is so great.  Animation is one of the many tools that we can use to inspire,,,,,
I have limits with the English language,,,,,
Go Melissa! What an awesome impact you've made! :),,,,,
I grew up with animation ever since I could remember. When I was a kid we only had a little black-and-white TV. We lived in Japan in my youth and animation was the only source of entertainment and the stories that were behind it. You didn't need the language to tell you what was the story . Stories were delivered through animation and the characters. I just got through doing a panel on Beauty and the Beast,,,,,
What a great moment. Make more films,,,,,
Love you guys! Happy New Year!!,,,,,
Talk about looking happy! Have the best 2018,,,,,
Lisa Marie Rothauser plein de bonheur pour vous les amoureux ❤️  et vos familles j’espère vous voir à New York en février !!! 😍😘😘,,,,,

The real question that need asked. What faction do you guys play in Dropzone/Fleet and why would you consider anything other than Scourge?,,,,,
If i manage to attend TTCon i'd love to get a glimpse behind the scenes. Design,,,,,

I'm really looking forward to the linked Campaign day at AdeptiCon,,,,,
Louis looks like a floating head...actually you both do 😂,,,,,
Events will have some exclusive stuff available on sight,,,,,
I guess they started with saying dfc and dzc get a combined book next and then it spiralled out to everything else,,,,,
keeping the awesome rules.  Getting an expansion.  Amazing!,,,,,
I really appreciate you guys doing live streams like this,,,,,
Looking forward to it. Also running a Zone tournament at Origins on Friday the 15th.,,,,,

Once you’ve downloaded your Time-In Toolkit Digital Manual,,,,,
I love the concept but I'm getting confused between the materials I got and what I need to download and make myself. It is not clear.,,,,,
I’m confused too. I bought the kit,,,,,
A video would be very helpful. I too am confused and thought I would open the toolkit and be able to use it right away.,,,,,
Jaime N Martinez,,,,,
I was confused at first but then started going thru the manual step by step and following the directions. It really works! Just take one small piece each day.,,,,,
My 3yo loved the stickers! She's starting to understand expressing herself,,,,,
Can't wait to get my kit,,,,,
How to buy this kit ? How much is it for ?,,,,,
Do you have plans to offer the game as a printed version? My home printer is not that great :(,,,,,
Joanna,,,,,
I was a pre-sale purchase,,,,,
Can you offer help to me as well? I was a pre-sale purchaser and do not have the digital manual. Thanks in advance.,,,,,
I have the same issue. Didn't receive or can't find the digital manual link. Tia,,,,,
Wendy Whitburn Wayne Whitburn,,,,,
I would love an online course I can do as the parent to learn more and ask questions.,,,,,
This is what I have for you Kendall!!,,,,,
pls mssg me directly. i purchased presale and dont know how to use materials,,,,,
I have the kit... good to see a visual of how this is played... do you have a suggestion of how to play a version for 4 year olds who aren’t reading yet? Thanks.,,,,,
so I have a 3 yo and one thing I did was print out the feelings that had the names on them twice and we play a matching game. When we get a match we talk about a time we felt that way.,,,,,

"My word for 2017 was ""stretch"" because I wanted to stretch in areas I need growth. For 2018",,,,,
I might steal Wonder from you for 2018! 😊,,,,,
2017 was Revival. And 2018,,,,,
Miracle for 2018 I would say mine was thankful for 2017.  Miracle defined as waking up every day and recognizing the plain truth that life is indeed a miracle.  We can walk with our legs,,,,,
Wonderment,,,,,
My word for 2018 (and I think this is a fabulous idea,,,,,
I love this thread! I’m still deciding on my 2018 word but am considering “simplify” as well as “serenity”. 🌺,,,,,
Thank you for this inspiring question! For 2017 my word was Trust. - I completed my graduate degree in social work and opened a community acupuncture clinic and sent my son to kindergarten in a public school. -For 2018 my word will be Growth. Growth of my business,,,,,
Love this! My 2018 word will be Balance. Finding the balance between family,,,,,
Jessica Wettlaufer Smith,,,,,
Mine might be Present,,,,,
What a great idea! Joy for 2018. This year has been a great year of great transitions from adding a family member to a move. This coming year will be challenging so we’ll need to find the joy in the little moments together. Happy new year❤️,,,,,
Love this idea...,,,,,
Mine is CHANGE something that I find the hardest thing to do and yet its just making small decisions one at a time to take a different path.,,,,,
2017 was a phrase for me “I choose love”. I got a leather bracelet from Hands Free Mama stamped with it and wore it to remind me. Haven’t decided on one for 2018 yet.,,,,,
My word for 2018: Lift,,,,,
My word for 2018 is Forward! We are moving into a new phase of life... last year was full of SO SO much change. This year is moving forward into the new things that life has for us.,,,,,
"How about  ""THANKFUL""   ????",,,,,
Reset,,,,,
My word finally found me...and it is simply JOY (the sort of joy that comes easily and everyday when I keep my filter set to “grateful”). ✨,,,,,
Mindful! This was my theme before I even found out about your group & the awesome time in toolkit,,,,,

Susan  Heather Kamie I invite you to check out this Toolkit! For your schools? Spread the love!,,,,,
Ashley Luaders Patek I just went to a training on this. It's so important for children and the adults working with them understand how they're feeling! We also learned at this training that time- out is for everyone. And you use it in a positive sense not always in a negative! Show your child how your taking a time- out for a few seconds to just take a breath.  You can use it in grocery stores wherever you are... or before you see a behavior starting!  A time -out doesn't necessarily mean sitting in a corner or being alone!  Teaching children how to use their words an correlating it with feelings so important!  This will be a practice we will use with Finley and in my job! Maddax is one lucky boy to HAVE YOU!! Karah Dee Kuhlman,,,,,

Brutal feedback: you’re speaking too fast and you sound like you’re reading it. You should be able to walk in there and talk about this (apparently) off the top of your head. Because you were reading,,,,,

If it is a family drama we need to hear more about how Dad’s undeadness is impacting everyone else in the family. What do the neighbours know or suspect? How do you handle having a protagonist who doesn’t have feelings(if ‘dead inside’?),,,,,
How gory is it? What makes it different to other zombie shows? Will they be Australian? What will the family be like? Can my kids watch it? There are some of my questions and comments 🙂,,,,,
Love it!,,,,,

I have a sous vide supreme and it's awesome!!!!  I bought mine off eBay a coupleof years ago. .  So easy to use and holds so much more than you would imagine.   it makes the most amazing chicken breast and filet mignon. Those are my two favorites.   you won't be able to eat chicken breasts any other way again.  Highly recommend getting one.  I like these better than the other sous vide stick versions because it's self contained all in one machine.,,,,,
What is the difference with the new version.   I've had mine for a few years and I can't imagine how to improve it except for different kinds of baskets,,,,,
Wow! Incredible.  Can't wait,,,,,
I would love one of these,,,,,

I have one,,,,,
This badboy will be cut into steaks and get the full treatment in my SousVide Supreme.   But there is still 5 weeks to go,,,,,
I think you left out one crucial difference. In. Fact it's the difference that unfortunately makes most people's decisions . The sous vide supreme costs significantly more than immersion circulatory . While I would love a Sous Vide supreme. I chose to buy 2 immersion circulators for the price of yours. This allows me to cook chicken and steak at the same time. Another thing I like about my immersion circulator is its controlled by my iPhone via Bluetooth or wifi  I do think for those that can afford it. The Sous Vide Supreme is a really nice piece of equipment.,,,,,
My own sous vide setup is an Auber PID and a rice cooker that predates the SousVide Supreme,,,,,

So cool! Love to see the process.,,,,,
I am still distraught by the size change,,,,,
Not me. Because I bought a reusable eco cover last year....that is now discontinued and NOT reusable.  😡,,,,,
No,,,,,
Maybe I could be excited about this if it was in a #classic size.,,,,,
I really wish you respected your #PashFam enough to not treat us like children.,,,,,
How about a glimpse of the new cover color??? :),,,,,
What time today will pre order start???,,,,,
Yay for floral designs!,,,,,
It’s April 23. How do I place my order,,,,,
Can a girl dream? Green 💚💚💚,,,,,
Megan Winter Alexis Sullivan,,,,,
Why cant we have all 3?,,,,,
sadly,,,,,
Nope. Not what your #PashFam wants and you are handling this so badly. I'm so disappointed.,,,,,
#justwrong give us back our choices,,,,,
Just right would be a choice between all three sizes.,,,,,
AKA “screw you if you got an eco sleeve” 😡,,,,,
I find it hilarious that they really don't seem to get how controversial this move is. It would be so much better to let the whole thing rest a bit,,,,,
the sheer anger of people on this post is mind-boggling to me. it's a planner,,,,,
Not right for me! What are we supposed to do with our eco-sleeves? What if the main reason we chose PP was it's Classic size??,,,,,
Not really. This was a poorly thought out decision and as much as I like the planner,,,,,
Will not be buying again if there’s no classic size!!!!,,,,,
I also like the compact because of portability. I don't want something the size of a comp book in my purse.,,,,,
"If by ""plenty of space"" you mean ""people who more need space bugger off"" then yeah",,,,,
Sad I like the classic for writing and business stuff and the compact for school and personal. That is too big for the planner pocket in my back pack and I liked the huge one to keep all the details. I was excited to get a medium one as an option but taking away the other two stinks.,,,,,
I’m disappointed to not have the option for the Classic size anymore. I’ve used my Passion Planner for my scheduling book for my home grooming business. A smaller size is not what I’m needing. Definitely not #justright for me.,,,,,
Nope,,,,,
I am disappointed as well! I was hoping for a slim hard book cover compact size with pen holder!...contains different colours and options inside :-( I really would like to know who wanted this !!!,,,,,
Lol they're probably sitting back and collecting this customer data as it unfolds on social media....,,,,,
Another vote for keeping the compact.,,,,,
#onesizedoesNOTfitall,,,,,
Tracy Enot Zlomie,,,,,
Amaris Cordero,,,,,
I am not a child who needs my decisions simplified! I chose the eco sleeve Classic because that was exactly what I wanted. I expected refills to be available in that size. Now I'm really annoyed,,,,,
I think I'm on my 4th Passion Planner and I have been a raving fan of your planners to anyone who will listen. This is Hugely Disappointing. I bought an Eco cover because you told us,,,,,
Hi,,,,,
I run 3 businesses and have another full time job.  Classic works for me ... if nothing else I can shove a form or 2 in there and not have to fold it. This change does NOT make me happy in the least. ADDING a size for those with analysis paralysis is one thing.... taking away the choices from everyone else... bad move.,,,,,
Sorry folks - I for one LOVE this!  And I think by streamlining their products,,,,,
So I now won’t be able to use the eco sleeve I invested in last year? I know there have been issues with the eco sleeve but I was looking forward to using the same sleeve year after year,,,,,
Personally,,,,,
Guess I’ll look for a new planner next year because I need the larger size.   And wow,,,,,
Why offer multiple start dates,,,,,
You’re making an awful decision!!!! Do clothing companies stop making long sleeves and tank tops to just make short sleeve shirts because people can’t decide between long sleeves and tank tops??!! You’re trying to avoid customer indecisiveness by only offering one product? Doubtful....call it what it is,,,,,
This doesn’t seem like a good idea. A lot of people have commented why,,,,,
So sorry to hear of this decision.  I have a leather cover from Italy that fits the Compact size which is the perfect size.  Sorry Passion Planner...I'll have to find another vendor to purchase my planner.  😐,,,,,
I am STOKED!!! After you guys graciously sent me a free planner because of the ridiculous problems with my eco I am not at all surprised that you are not offering the eco. To offer a free replacement says to me that this was a huge problem and you didn’t want to have so many dissatisfied customers. Also,,,,,
Wow. Not what I was expecting. I just wasted a ton of money on classic sized stickers for next year. Not a happy passion planner fan right now.,,,,,
I for one,,,,,
I am a die hard passion planner fan,,,,,
I understand that the business needs to make decisions that are best for the business,,,,,
Will there be a spot on the website where we can see what a sample page will look like? I have vision problems (an aneurism in my right eye),,,,,
I am in. I am here for it! Been with Passion Planner since the first Kickstarter and I'm not going anywhere. I was going to move up to the Classic for 2019,,,,,
I can get behind this 😊 I started my first year in the #PashFam with a classic but I’m now a compact girl. The middle sounds like the best of both worlds!,,,,,
Passion Planner- This is my first year with you. I purchased Eco Classic and Compact. A ) Consider accepting orders for inserts for Eco and bound planners for these established sizes by a certain cut-off date only   B ) For Eco adopters like myself,,,,,
I'm nervous. I hate change. lol!! I have been using the classic size for three years. Yikes.,,,,,
Thank you Passion Planner for listening to me and so many others! We will now finally have the PERFECT size! I’ve been a loyal customer for five years and have used the Compact,,,,,
I love my compact size Planner and have been a customer for a few years now. As I understand I can get a undated compact size for next year but I don't really think I will like having to fill in all the dates. I'll give the new one a try because the Passion Planner is the best one that I have used and over the years and I have tried them all.,,,,,
I measured my ipad,,,,,
by the way,,,,,
2018 is my second year of using the small size Passion Planner. I also gave one to each of my granddaughters for Christmas.  This size planner fit into my tote with lots of extra room,,,,,
Biggest disappointment ever. Listening to a vocal minority is the surest way to eliminate the majority of your customers.,,,,,
Make it any shade of purple and I. Am. In!,,,,,
If it’s a 7x9 I will buy a planner for this year even though I already have one! 😜 love the idea of a mid-size!!,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,
Mid sized!!!!!!,,,,,
Not a good surprise,,,,,
Still waiting on green 💚 Work with me.....lol,,,,,
And those colors😱,,,,,
New mid-size planner Kara San Joaquin??,,,,,
Can you imagine if it's NOT a mid-sized?!?!  Hahahahahahahaha...we're all here hoping!!!,,,,,
ooooo.... is there a mid size planner in the works???,,,,,
Jess a medium sized one! I have been waiting for this for years <3,,,,,
Mid size would be so great :),,,,,
So excited because I believe it’s a midsize planner. The perfect size for me!!! Oh please be true 🙏🏼💖🙏🏼💖🙏🏼,,,,,
A medium sized planner! Close to the EC or Happy Planner size!,,,,,
I'm thinking that mid size planner is in it's way...,,,,,
Excited for a new mid size,,,,,
Could it be a medium size?!?!  I'm SO excited!,,,,,
Waiting to order a new one in hopes you will have a mid-size...🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼,,,,,
7x9 passion planner?,,,,,
Please oh please!?,,,,,
Hello passion planner,,,,,

Is there some kind of discount code for international deliveries and I really need this planner but want to avoid the $20 shipping if possible 🙂,,,,,
Would love some discounts on the undated and Canadian shopping,,,,,
Joshua Linsangan i already bought 2 but paid for shipping,,,,,
Chrissie Alexander,,,,,
Cristina Barkowski 😗,,,,,
Raegan Swearingen,,,,,
Jax Clark,,,,,
"""Red",,,,,
Every week I look at the monthly calendar and map out what my week will look like. I color code,,,,,
I loved this! I also love that the two people who swapped planners weren't over the top with Washi tape,,,,,
i write down what i need to do each day and any appts made go in the calendar boxes preceding the daily pages,,,,,
Oh Chelseas’...y’all are great👌🏽,,,,,
Please make more videos like this!! Too funny!!,,,,,
Where can I find those amazing panda stickers?!,,,,,
MY FAVORITE CHELSEAS!!! <3 <3,,,,,
I love multicolor pens 💕,,,,,
closed captioning? please.,,,,,
You're my favorite Chelsea! ;),,,,,
Ashley Dawn,,,,,
Love this! 😂,,,,,
I love love you guys,,,,,
😂😂 Chelsea you’re too funny! Miss ya,,,,,
😂,,,,,
Awesome,,,,,
awesome!,,,,,
My advice to a new Passion Planner user is try to be flexible. There is no wrong or right way.  Try different things that could work for you. If one doesn't work,,,,,
Do you have a customer service contact number? I’m needing to talk to someone on the phone!,,,,,
You read my mind ... I didn’t have a clue where to start apart from writing appointments in LOL,,,,,
I never got the free one I signed up for when it first came out 😡,,,,,
Lol just if I had enough time to play and make things look pretty lol not so much.,,,,,
I did it! And I have a full time job,,,,,
I would sure like to know what they are doing here and why,,,,,
I’m not going to take the time to tape it up.,,,,,
Now I feel totally inadequate 😖,,,,,
"Passion Planner I love this video! Great sneak peak into someone else's planner. Could you post a pic of the ""finished""page that we child examine a bit closer up?",,,,,
I really like these videos and seeing how other people are utilizing their planners. Sometimes it’s difficult to customize them as there are so many possibilities. Thanks for posting!,,,,,
I submitted a request for customer service and haven’t heard anything back. Do you have a phone number?,,,,,
Brandon Who honestly has the time for this? Lol,,,,,
Love this video and love the Passion Planner. <3,,,,,
Where is the super thin washi tape used in this video from? The red/fuchsia used to outline “work” time...?,,,,,
I honestly cant put into words how much I love this planner! Its going to be my annual gift to myself! Love it!,,,,,
Where can you buy all these stickers....,,,,,
Brittany Gina Erika Rae Sadie seriously this is so satisfying to watch!,,,,,
What kind of gray pen or marker is it that was used to delineate the “work” hours (the rectangle-ish shape)?,,,,,
Vanessa - how cool is this diary? Thought of you and yours,,,,,
That’s what highlighters are for,,,,,
Joanna Limas let's get our life together,,,,,
Katie Roesch here is a bit of a breakdown of what all to be put into planner,,,,,
Alicia this looks like way too much work...,,,,,
Joëlle Meijer Paula Meijer-Hofing zo kan t ook,,,,,
Jade thanks for getting me into passion planners!  Using my passion planner helped my turn my dreams into goals,,,,,
Tammy Rivera i think we've both learned that there are more ways to save memories,,,,,
Joseph Liu as we said on Instagram the #pashfam has fostered not only communal growth within our college but also personal growth and we reflect together at the end of weeks and months as to how we can continue to grow more and it's been beautiful to see how the Passion Planner has helped us not only be more organized people but have a calm,,,,,
Oh yes ma'am Gracia JB... I like the creativity and the ingenuity of this planner... kudos to Team  Passion Planner 🤗🤗🤗 thanks ma'am grace for introducing Passion Planner. We need this ma'am for 2018,,,,,
Olivia Sye,,,,,
It helps me believe that what I do and what I continue to dream is always possible if you would just have faith and courage in accomplishing your plans/goals in life. 😇 I really want to share the victory with you mylove Junicor Manrique If ever that I will be chosen as the lucky winner. We can use this planner to achieve our future plans and greatest dreams together.💑😍😇💋 #pashfam #passionplanner,,,,,
Being a part of the #pashfam allows me to be creative while setting short and long term goals for myself while keeping myswlf accountable every step of the way. It also allows me to observe how others set up their Passion planners to gain new ideas. I have Amy to thank for getting me into Passion Planners during one of our classes last year! 😍,,,,,
Shenna Carpenter i am seriously in need of this year's planner. From Twitter,,,,,
Being apart of the #PASHFAM has taught me goals and dreams are achievable when you take the time to layout the steps and tasks. The roadmap and game changer have had the greatest impact. I would share this planner with you,,,,,
My daughter Meghan McNamara introduced me to the #pashfam.  She shared her passion for organizing,,,,,
It’s been awesome to write goals and plan out dreams with Ken Ramos  and help each other break down goals into simple tasks. I love the positive quotes and encouragement of the #pashfam,,,,,
Ken Cranor I hope you are enjoying the planner I gave you for Xmas. I have found mine to be extremely helpful with keeping me organized and motivated these last couple years! 😄,,,,,
Darlene Lescano I learned that things you really want to accomplish take a lot of time & energy to plan. However,,,,,
Antonia Rutzen I've never used passion planner before but I'd really like to plan my year in a fun way. Passion Planner really inspires to be creative and to achieve goals by keeping track of all appointments whether they are business or fun activities ❤,,,,,
Ohh I've learned lots of creative ideas around logging loads of different info in my planner love seeing all the pictures people post of their ideas😍 Katona Fatta Katalin these are fab for managing your time x,,,,,
John Nash III I've learned that Senior Aides can better become employed and happy if they learn how to use a Passion Planner to set and track goals: instead of sitting around spinning their wheels they get a plan,,,,,
Ashley Elizabeth- I’ll never forget when you introduced me to passion planner. I LOVE mine - I find I am more organized and look at more positives with the areas to write goals and inspirational quotes. ❤️,,,,,
Something truly awesome is that I randomly struck up a conversation with one of my new colleagues,,,,,
Julienne Seguro I’ve learned that it is beautiful to commemorate & celebrate life’s goals turned into achievement with the Passion Planner and we don’t have to be perfect! we just have to start knowing what our goals are and start writing our plans down so that together,,,,,
Jessica Walker! One thing I’ve learned is that there’s no one way to use the Passion Planner. You like washi tape,,,,,
This will be awesome for my husband Andre Van T Geloof. He is so jealous of me because I already have such a wonderful Passion Planner. He always gets stuck in his planning,,,,,
Hein San Being in the #pashfam has taught me that realizing my goals and dreams(which I once thought were unreachable) by breaking down into small steps,,,,,
Christy the passion planner helps me look back and see how much I've accomplished. No way I could remember the kids milestones on my own!,,,,,
AprilandBobby See  Passion Planner has taught me the importance and value of appreciating what I have. Being able to write down my gratitudes,,,,,
Emily Mitchell Strait Using this planner helped me train for my marathon among other personal and professional goals I have set for myself over the past 3 years. I love using this planner!,,,,,

I am curious about your delivery to Amazon suppliers.  I ordered in December a PP2018 via Amazon but they rescheduled delivery 2x saying they are all out and have no idea when the PP company will supply them.  Amazon has prime which helps with shipping costs so I went with them.  Any suggestions???,,,,,
Are all dated planners except black one start from Sunday?,,,,,
These planners are dated last August 2017 to June/July 2018,,,,,
Grr missed it to. Off to Target I guess,,,,,
Will the undated be available again in other colors?,,,,,
Happy new year 2018!,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,
I'm ordering mine now.,,,,,
UGH!!!!! I missed it! grrrrrrrrr,,,,,
That's not Santa: his hands are too skinny!!!,,,,,
I bet Santa uses the blank PP because he'd need multiple days to accomplish his 24 hr. Christmas Eve tasks.  OR He might print off blank pages and add them in.... I use my PP to track gifts year around in my gift closet.  Merry Christmas PP,,,,,
What pen is that though :O,,,,,
Merry Christmas PP'peeps🎄🎄🎅🎅,,,,,
Of course! How else would he get so much done??? Merry Christmas to you all at #passionplanner Thanks for all you do!,,,,,
I get my first Passion Planner for Christmas today!! Merry Christmas 🎄,,,,,

"Which of Santa's reindeer has bad manners? ""Rude""-olph!",,,,,
What did Rudolph say when they landed near a puddle? “Must have reind-eer!”,,,,,
My 2018 passion planner is sitting waiting and ready. My first pashplanner and I'm so looking forward to my greatest year yet 2018 baby!!  -Good things come to those who wait. Great things are obtained by those who  GO. GET. IT!!,,,,,
My friend and I have a standing approach to the next years passion planner... We make a time towards the end of the year (this year it's this Friday) and we go for coffee and ignore each other for a few hours while update our new planner,,,,,
Need to make that time to plan for 2018.  I have been lovingly glancing at my rose gold and thinking,,,,,
Merry Christmas and for 2018 Lots of love from Holland 💋,,,,,
I just ordered my Eco planner with the sleeve on Monday.  Looking forward to it.  After I ordered I found several friends that have used your planners.  ( I never knew )  Share with your friends everyone...  Some may be looking for a good planner. without the HUGE $$$,,,,,

Muy bien Anna,,,,,
Muy sabias palabras Anna; revisemos nuestro interior y después nos criticamos a nosotros mismos. Porque es fácil echarle la culpa a nuestro alrededor cuando debemos de ser conscientes de tener la fuerza y el coraje para salir adelante y estar unido con el que está abajo de nosotros y con el que este arriba. Todos aprendemos de todos. 🤟🏼✌🏼🌺,,,,,

Remember that time chell was playing with corys phone and accidentally live streamed for half an hour before cory noticed.,,,,,
I always imagined stars when looking at the light through blankets like that when I was little too! :),,,,,
Hi guys. Really hope to get the chance to meet you when we are in Tulsa in June for Shelby Mid America car show event. Love your family.,,,,,
I'm going to have nightmares lol,,,,,
22.21 for me as well...Have to get up at 6am...But have to watch this first!!!,,,,,
Thanks again for making my birthday guys! ;) May not have been intentional but it worked! :) Have fun! 😍 I've got to go and enjoy the melting snow! lol!,,,,,
May want to get it down. A high wind will take it down. We just had a wind storm with 89MPH gusts. My fence is half gone because of it.,,,,,
Just no pillow fights like me you and Justin use to have. Hahaha,,,,,
Greetings from Finland! 🇫🇮♥️ You guys make HelloFresh sound amazing as I'm sure it is. I'd love to study in the USA and if I ever do I'd love to try HelloFresh.,,,,,
Cory thanks so much for randomly going live today. you made me smile and laugh! I've been real down today,,,,,
I've never played Portal but I think I should 🤔 I have a few weeks of school left so I think I'll check them out then!,,,,,
I'm behind on vlogs. I'm in January. It seems I have a lot of Chell saying new words to look forward to,,,,,
Wish you could see how zoned out my 19 mo old daughter Harleigh is watching you guys so quiet and happy,,,,,
Cory,,,,,
for atlas's bedroom  you need a painting of atlas on one wall but instead of the earth pick your favorite fantasy world !,,,,,
her the time is 22.20,,,,,
I think you guys should come and visit Norway! :D,,,,,
omg shes so stinkin big!! and cute!!!!  it feels like just yesterday i watched you bring her home from the hospital. :D,,,,,
I miss snuggle bug years. My 3 year old is all hyper now haha,,,,,
You going do that funny dance when we hear heart beat when kristen in labour xx,,,,,
Omg I’m so glad I got to see your video. Lol. Are you still live??,,,,,
I've been subbed to Cory when he was a newbie,,,,,
Chell is just like “what the??!?” Lol,,,,,
Oh the sharks is from a YouTube video,,,,,
Oh my that would hurt to shave lol,,,,,
That's what happens when you have parents that pay attention and include them instead of ignore them. Our son was reading fluently at age 2 1/2. He is still a book lover at 38.,,,,,
Children will learn to mimic spellings of words or the individual numbers,,,,,
The way you live your lives,,,,,
Can spell her name,,,,,
My firstborn knew how to read when he went into K. My 2nd child did not even tho I read to her and did things the same. My 3rd one did just like the firstborn. So it's just a roll of the dice sometimes. They all graduated with wonderful grades and are a credit to their communities.,,,,,
She is doing great. A lot has to do with how you both are great parents. You listen to the advice of others,,,,,
Average family can’t even have one parent stay home. But they can read to them daily at bedtime and other times. I had friend who went through great deal to have her 2 kids. I can recall her being upset when her son didn’t even know his ABC’s and all other kids did with many reading. She just never read to them.,,,,,
Whoopwhoop guys it’s all about loving & enjoying being parents,,,,,
She is so intelligent,,,,,
I just looked at this video and OH MY GOSH,,,,,
Nicole I am so behind on vlogs I was shocked to hear words let alone hear her spell. Little peanut is too big.,,,,,
She is sooo intelligent!! Noticed when she was a baby like she was trying to understanding things...,,,,,
I HOPE YOU ALL ARE SAFE.  I just saw that there is a fire in Oklahoma.,,,,,
My daughter was born in September right after Chell,,,,,
Such a beautiful little girl you both have! Happy Easter to you all!,,,,,
Especially that she wanted to lick it off the table,,,,,
My 3 yr old Grandson is at kindergarten level..he is a sweet heart 💕,,,,,
Watch out,,,,,
Good job Chell you are so smart happy Easter,,,,,
It’s because chell,,,,,
She's so smart.,,,,,
WOW,,,,,
Of course,,,,,
She’s a smart little cookie!!!,,,,,
Hey Chell,,,,,
Are you guys ever going to do meet ups? My sister in laws friend said she seen you guys at the aquarium but was to afraid to say hi lol :),,,,,
Hi Cory and Chill!! Don't know if you remember but I'm the guy that sent you that Portal hoodie back when Portal 2 was coming out. :),,,,,
Hi from Alaska. We used to live in Eagle River. Are in Fairbanks now! :),,,,,
It's those Alaskan roots that have her so smart :),,,,,
It so amazing watching Chell grow :),,,,,
But,,,,,
Chell is better at doing her hair than I am,,,,,
But what does the fox say,,,,,
Hello Mister Safety ! lol long time no see (from ergo pictures actually) :P  you have a kid omg !! xD !!! So cute :D Have a LOVELY LOVELY DAY!!!,,,,,
She is going to be doing her own vlogs soon......she can do one about all her toys,,,,,
It reminds me when I was recording my little cousin and he put the microphone in his mouth! LOL!,,,,,
Boy,,,,,
my 21 month old just gave Chell an Eskimo kiss!,,,,,
Yeah she’s done her own live streams. She’s old hat at this game!,,,,,
Yes,,,,,
You are doing so well,,,,,
Cory she is so cute!! Congratulations on the new baby 💕,,,,,
You should buy her everything for xmas,,,,,
Cory she is going to take over the vlogs soon...lol,,,,,
I hope you are having a wonderful day!,,,,,
poor Sparta forgotten lol,,,,,
Lovely kisses,,,,,
lol she says you said enough,,,,,
Are you having fun with the horses??,,,,,
Wow. There are a lot of flexible people in your family!,,,,,
Oh that game! Some people are just extra flexible. I’m a relatively fat bastard and I excel at that (as long as I’m wearing loose trousers),,,,,
Why is there a topless man in the background? 😂,,,,,
I would fall on my face and not be able to get up again. Lol,,,,,
Seriously could you have married a better family corey !!! They totally match your crazy fun try anything personality.  Love it ♡♡♡♡,,,,,
They have to stand on a book and peel the tape off the floor? Only way I can figure to make it lower is something like that.,,,,,
Dude! I tried and almost fell into an accidental split! LOL Ouch!,,,,,
Last time I saw this game most people were drunk lol,,,,,
Finally get to see you all live! Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family Cory!,,,,,
What’s up family! Happy thanksgiving from Vancouver Canada!,,,,,
Cory and Kristen! Love you guys! ❤️ Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃,,,,,
watched you before,,,,,
Happy Thanksgiving too your family!!,,,,,
your family is so fun thank you for sharing.,,,,,
What in the world is this game? Never seen it before,,,,,
That looks like a fun family to be part of.,,,,,
You need to use steps or something now so the papers are lower than ground level.,,,,,
Happy Thanksgiving Cory,,,,,
Hey Cory and  Kristin,,,,,
Happy thanksgiving Cory and baby chell,,,,,
This is a family tradition at our family Thanksgiving.,,,,,
Oh what great family fun... We are game players,,,,,
The only way I can think of to make it lower is to cut a hole in the floor and put a bowl in the hole. LOL,,,,,
WOW!\,,,,,
and you get your floor mopped in the process! WTG!,,,,,
Huh I thought it was a truckload of ninjas???,,,,,
Why do you wear that shit on your eyes,,,,,
Awwww,,,,,
Rx: Eat 1 brain twice a day for 10 days. If no improvement,,,,,
Even with a zombie virus Chell is super adorable. Cutest zombie I have ever seen,,,,,
This was so great. A family that zombies together,,,,,
Noooooooooooo!!!!! Not Chell!!!!!,,,,,
It looks like Cory and Chell have been infected by the rat plague and became a couple of weepers (Dishonored reference).,,,,,
Your always making the best of a bad situation feel better Happy Halloween 👻,,,,,
Feel better Cory,,,,,
You look how I felt yesterday.  Had to take Benadryl before a test they gave me and it packed a punch on me.,,,,,
Happy Halloween,,,,,
Oh dear. So you are starting to look like me when I wake up at 6a.m.,,,,,
I knew cutting caffeine would be a change,,,,,
chells shirt is wet. how many times did you do this to her xD,,,,,
:) awesome lol seriously though ,,,,,
Lol if you have the same cold I do,,,,,
That’s horrible to look at. Hope you feel batter soon,,,,,
omg,,,,,
yes the virus is getting worse but your editing skills are improving greatly,,,,,
Hope Chell didn't scare herself in the mirror x,,,,,
Kida looks like some of my vics in Fallout 4,,,,,
Screw being a Disney princess! Zombies are much more exciting! XD,,,,,
I Chell is the most convincing!,,,,,
Can Kristen start doing pregnancy vlogs? I would love to see those! Thank you for all you do! I love watching your family ❤️,,,,,
React to BEER TRAIN! that was a hilarious vlog! Oh and how about the first video that Kristen was in! Before you moved!,,,,,
Kristen’s disgusted/grunting face while watching herself give birth is absolutely the face every mother makes when watching someone give birth 😂,,,,,
I love the difference between Cory and Kristen’s faces watching the birth vlog 😂,,,,,
Ahhhh cory you're so precious i love how in touch with your emotions you are and how you love kristen the way you do equally i love how kristen is all in all she's just... a complimentary piece of you in a way i couldnt say ever before. If i was to recommend a video to look back on its the one where kristen asked you to come with her to alaska in the first place when you had all those issues in california at the end of the vlog having not told u prior and the way she involved us in that surprise during a vlog.. that was special but also in the announcement that you guys were pregnant again i love how she embraced the vlog life xxxxxxx,,,,,
Beautiful,,,,,
The moment Cory started crying I did too lol happens EVERY TIME! You guys are such a beautiful family! <3,,,,,
Cory,,,,,
Will this be on YouTube once it stops being broken? Facebook video is weird for me. :(,,,,,
-The day you guys did the Polar Plunge. - The one when Chell she giggled so much at Cory making weird faces that she farted. -The day Cory came back from Naked and Afraid. -When Kristen put the Tens unit on Cory to stimulate labor pains.  Also I think you,,,,,
Cory,,,,,
I cried with you Cory... Amazing movies made and still in the making. Even though you think you need to be out more,,,,,
Kristen,,,,,
Love watching you two. The one I would love to see is the time Cory sat under the tree and the snow fell on him.,,,,,
I still cry each time I watch my kids videos of being born,,,,,
Go way way back to when you went to the concentration camp auschwitz.. and the holocust museum.. that first part of that vlog,,,,,
I can't watch Chell's birth without crying either,,,,,
Saw the exact moment you started to cry,,,,,
That was wonderful. I don't get to watch your vlogs as regularly as I did 6 years ago. So these were vlogs I had missed so it was nice to see them,,,,,
''Driving at five months old'' is another good one. Those outside shots are soo incredible,,,,,
Hi Cory,,,,,
I’m with you Kristen. I don’t cry that often unless I’m having an emotional breakdown or watching something that makes me cry. But I don’t cry that much,,,,,
You are such a sweet person Cory,,,,,
You should react to your old vlogs when Cory lived in California and definitely when Kristen was carrying Chell. 💖💖💖,,,,,
You both are so positive,,,,,
Right around the 3:48 mark of this video,,,,,
Can't link at the moment but: The beer train vlogs,,,,,
The shock collar videos because those were REALLY funny when you and your friend took turns shocking each other. APMSL when I watched it,,,,,
Cory,,,,,
I’d say one of you’re  first vlogs,,,,,
First Family Road Trip at 10:58  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfE6Dsh9Ars  It's your Denali trip and the part where you are really high up on a narrow dirt road with no guardrails!,,,,,
Oh I would love to see the first pregnancy announcement being watched again since you’re expecting another little one!,,,,,
Pranking Blake and Lucinda video. When Kristen saw the animals on the drive to Alaska. Beer train was epic too. So many options!,,,,,
Sumo wrestling on a lake (sorry,,,,,
This has to be one of your more recent funniest videos  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9FuBRum2_w   I loved how you went through the simulated labor pains and how Kristen's parents were frantically laughing and when Kristen turned it up all the way how you were yelling STOP STOP STOP!!!    That was and still is so funny!!!,,,,,
"This is one of my all-time favorites: when you ""officially"" introduced the pets to Chell",,,,,
Cory I've been watching you since your days on MySpace to moving onto YouTube. I never commented back then just watched your ups and downs,,,,,
When Corey comes back from Naked and Afraid and Chell sees him for the first time in ages. Sorry I can't do a link on my phone.,,,,,
I would LOVE to see your reactions to your driving to Alaska vlogs! I'm from Northern British Columbia,,,,,
I just loved when you ripped Santa's head off in home depot,,,,,
How about a reaction to the dudelikehella song. I just love and miss that song. Like just a repeat of it. I digress. I miss the songs. Make a song please.,,,,,
I just saw the one u posted like 6 years ago introducing Dude Like Hella,,,,,
My favourite vlog was the London meet up vlog “new world record September 10th 2011”   But I’m bias because I feature in it briefly 😅✨  (You don’t have to watch that one back if it’s a bit too far back for you my dude),,,,,
I would absolutely love to see your reactions to the old Fallout Nuka Break filming episode… Clear back when the channel started. You taped your old camera to a wheel and rolled it down some stairs. Unfortunately there is one spot of  language in that one… But to me,,,,,
It took me like 30 seconds to think of what DHL stood for even though I’ve been watching for years haha.,,,,,
I laughed like crazy when Kristen ordered you the prehistoric costume and you put it on and ran down the driveway.  Your legs looked like they were only a foot long.  OMG FUNNY,,,,,
Maybe when you first moved into your house in Eagle River.. and then talk about how much you miss Alaska and want to come back??? lol,,,,,
I kinda wish you had your old channel trailer from back when you started vlogging. Idk why,,,,,
What kind of vlogging camera are you using nowadays Cory?  I STILL have the old canon elph 300 hs and have been using it for over 6 years!!!,,,,,
The very first vlog you were both in. Or being that you are expecting again,,,,,
I hate mine being touched too,,,,,
I’m glad I’m not the only one who hates their belly button being touched! I get made fun of all the time. 😔,,,,,
Good morning! Love watching Chell torture...I mean play...with her Dada lol So cute,,,,,
I don't like mine being touch either it's so weird 😨 well done Chell for trying 😂,,,,,
I hate mine being touched as well! It’s super deep so it just irks me.,,,,,
She's won the tickle battle and the giggle battle.,,,,,
I love ❤️ the daddy daughter love ❤️,,,,,
My honey is the exact sane way hates his belly button touched and does this same little wiggle Cory does. That's hilarious! Get em Chell!!,,,,,
Glad she’s not mad at korey anymore,,,,,
Happy to see you guys Happy 😃   I’ve been watching your Alaskan videos again since they brought so much joy and hope to my life and they still do. Plus my cat loves your voices Lol,,,,,
Love this family! I've been watching them since I found Cory and Kristan on their trip to Alaska. On days they don't vlog,,,,,
So cute father and daughter bonding.so lovable kids,,,,,
Hope her little fingernails are trimmed.,,,,,
chels,,,,,
Pssst Chell,,,,,
One of these days she's going to do this and they aren't going to have pants on lol,,,,,
I love how there's 670 people watching a wall right now just because it's LiveEachDay 😂 I love the dedication towards them ☺️,,,,,
"Chell must have thought we all needed to ""vent""",,,,,
I think Chell won this pranking war in the family :D,,,,,
Only LiveEachDay could get 800 people to stare at a wall and be happy about it,,,,,
Seriously,,,,,
I'm listening very closely! Were gonna hear all of their secrets! Kristin our plans for world domination through this liveeachday channel  are coming through muahahahaha,,,,,
Chell is better at pranking Cory than Kristin!,,,,,
This just proves Cory is the same on and off camera,,,,,
I missed the beginning,,,,,
I'm staying on this stream until somebody ends it great way to spend my birthday! Thank you chell!,,,,,
This makes me feel like a forgotten toy in toystory,,,,,
This is chell with a weekend bonus vlog 😂😂😂,,,,,
What if he gets a world record for the most people watching an unknown live stream - is that a thing?,,,,,
so do you all come to this ceiling often,,,,,
Proves he pays more attention to his child than phone 👍,,,,,
Even if someone calls it's like... Oh yeah we're by the ... Ceiling? Next to one of your many doors.... Hide and seek modern day style.,,,,,
at least hes wearing pants lol,,,,,
Should we tweet at Kristen?,,,,,
1000 bottles of beer on the wall....,,,,,
So who hopes they have a boy?,,,,,
I know right....somehow feels a bit creepy wrong...but...here we all are still watching...lol,,,,,
I feel like I should be doing something more productive,,,,,
Best ceiling I've ever watched,,,,,
Cory is such a wonderful daddy to Chell,,,,,
Her smile brightens my day every time I see it. She's got the sweetest little face. I thank you so much for letting us in and sharing your lives with us.,,,,,
She's so cute as she inches forward bravely with momma guiding her....certainly a prophecy of the future.  Good job momma and congrats on the little sprout.,,,,,
Cyril Joe cute right 👀,,,,,

Mirjam Buitenhuis-Zuetenhorst,,,,,
I think I've watched this 5 times now. I try not to because it makes me cry.. XD I dunno why! I think they're happy tears cause this video is just so damn adorable! I've been following your work from way back when you first started,,,,,
Wonder just how different this would have been had chell not come along and had corey create the book .  Utterly love this version though,,,,,
I think Sparta is one special cat...I used to call him a personable cat.  He put up with that horrid little white doggie.  Yet seems fine with Penny,,,,,
Hi guys! I'm a long time viewer of DudeLikeHELLA,,,,,
Loved and shared twice.  🍁,,,,,
Jeez,,,,,
Awww so glad you are doing videos again Cory and your daughter is just darling. Shout out for using my hometown Tulsa and other parts of Oklahoma in your video. 💖,,,,,
I LOVE that you kept parts of the original with the new and yeah Chell steals the video completely....I know it is about sparta but yeah Chell is clearly the starr!!!!,,,,,
"Omg i remeber you dude!!!! Soooo many years. ""Wheressss kitteeeee""  Hehehe love this If you dont know this guy. Please watch previous version of this on YouTube",,,,,
my nephew loved both the mean kitty song.. and the big mean kitty video!!!! I cant wait for him to enjoy the book as well :),,,,,
You did a great job with the new music video! Well worth the time and energy you put into it!,,,,,
Lily and I actually just watched this. Lily loves Chell. She is 18 months now and every time she sees Chell,,,,,
My 5 yr old already sings it lol. We have watched it at least 12 times now. This music video has cheered me up every time ive watched it. Your hard work more than payed off.,,,,,
Well done Corey,,,,,
Cory,,,,,
I love this so much and I've shared it like.. three times. The effects are so cool,,,,,
I've been watching your videos on SMPFilms and The Mean Kitty since 2006,,,,,
Going to share it with my goddaughter when she wakes up from nap!,,,,,
Oh my gosh. I remember when you first put out the video and song 'Mean Kitty'. Sparta wasn't very old then. You have come a long way since then. Congratulations.,,,,,
This was an awesome video ! Chell completely stole the show when she was dancing on the couch!! I smiled while watching the whole thing! 💕,,,,,
Cory! It turned out so great,,,,,
I enjoyed the original and love this new updated version. Something tells me Chell will be just as much into cinematography as you.,,,,,
The whole thing is very cool! Great story,,,,,
Greg Nelson we need to get this for the kids! They love this song and I am sure they would love the book! Plus it would be a new book to add to their reading logs for school.,,,,,
Emily Mitchell!! Remember the mean kitty Sparta? That was 10 years ago! And Cory made a new one. I've watched it about 5 times and I love it. Lol!! The kids loved it too. 😄,,,,,
Not a good idea to let that one have a toothbrush,,,,,
Today's lesson taught by Chell...This is how you gag your Mother with a toothbrush,,,,,
"anyone else recoil in ""owww"" when you hear the toothbrush hit Kristen's tooth?",,,,,
Haha,,,,,
She so pretty,,,,,
Chell is getting so big and she's so darn cute.😊,,,,,
"Too cute🤣 my daughter likes to ""help"" me brush too",,,,,
Love y'all miss chelle is growing up so fast,,,,,
This eclipse came at a great time. People were concentrating on this and it actually felt like a country again instead of a constant fight!,,,,,
Okay,,,,,
Is there no vlog today Cory & Kristen? I have been waiting all day for this vlog that you said was coming today and there isn't a vlog 🤷‍♀️ and ☹️X hope you put a 1 up I love seeing you all having adventures and fun X,,,,,
It was storming here (Las Vegas) this morning.  One of our web guys bought the entire department Eclipse glasses so that we could all go outside and check it out this morning - but unfortunately it was totally clouded over and raining. It got slightly darker outside but we were in the 72-76% zone so there wasn't much change given the weather.,,,,,
that is so awesome,,,,,
In Nederland (The Netherlands/Holland) was an eclips at 3 october 2005. It`s a weird natural phenomenon! It`s darker and colder for a moment and chickens are going to sleep,,,,,
WE ONLY GOT 90% TOTALITY. I WAS EXPECTING MORE LIKE THIS,,,,,
An okie here,,,,,
I was watching & it didn't get as dark where I am,,,,,
That was so cool,,,,,
Very cool! We were at 97% totality where I live and loved watching the light change to a golden hour tone in the middle of the day.,,,,,
It's more like 'a time lapse of our home DURING the eclipse,,,,,
The eclipse was awesome. At first was afraid was not going to be able to see it due to clouds,,,,,
Hey  that was awesome.  In other news,,,,,
Hey,,,,,
I love your video that is what I wanted to see,,,,,
Oml,,,,,
It didn't get that dark for us and we are in the 90% zone. Even looking at the sun (with approved equipment) it didn't have much of an eclipse. 😒,,,,,
Very cool! Like someone is using a dimmer on the sun.  The sun was only covered at about 60% in Montreal so it didn't make a big difference on the ambiant light.,,,,,
My college had a big festival and NASA came out for it! It was easily the coolest thing I've experienced in my life so far!,,,,,
I remember the one we had here in the UK ...very odd and  eerie light at totality !,,,,,
Super super cool! Glad that you have experienced and filmed it :D,,,,,
That's awesome! You new home is beautiful,,,,,
It got much darker for you than where I live,,,,,
I feel horrible I slept through the eclipse,,,,,
Not me I'm having a good day cus its my birthday  woot btw happy belated birthday Cory,,,,,
"Hi sweet ""Miss Chell Marie""! Hope you are loving your new home with your parents and pets.",,,,,
Gday chell ♡  my little girl got a doll for her  6th birthday and has named her chell marie she goes everywhere with her  Know she wishes she had the real one to hang out with,,,,,

OMG ! It just don't get any cuter than that :) I will confess I watched ya'll before Chell was born,,,,,
She is just the CUTEST,,,,,
I needed this myself you have no clue I've been watching you guys since before you found out you are pregnant and I really needed to see Chells cute face,,,,,
Chell is so stinking cute. I am enjoying watching her grow. My one and only baby is 16 and not a momma's girl anymore. I found you shortly after you moved to Alaska and I have been following you every day. Thank you Cory,,,,,
Awww... Chell always brightens up my day. Actually your whole family does.,,,,,
Alyshea Dobo,,,,,

Seeing her sweet lil face will never tire. She is just so stinkin cute. I miss my babies being that small.. All preteen and up now.,,,,,
Oh my god this is so cute! She never stops being adorable. Kristen,,,,,
You are so right.  I just can't stop smiling at this one.,,,,,
Chantal Gersch I saw this and thought you might need a baby in your life 😜😜,,,,,
Mus Mehenni I don't know if you had a bad day...but this is so cuuuute,,,,,
Benjamin Honor-McKeen Natasha Brown-Butler we all know I'm having the bad day today but Chell always makes me smile so I share the cute!,,,,,
Please include in a video,,,,,
Hi guys! I don't know if you'll see this but as a fan I wrote a little jingle that popped into my head and wrote it down.  Please bare in mind that I'm not a professional song writer and I'm only 19 years of age,,,,,
Ultra cute! So much fun to see you guys out with friends,,,,,
You all should come visit the St. Louis Zoo. Voted America's favorite zoo..and above all it is FREE. We also have a free science center and an awesome place called Grants Farm with all sorts of animals and even the beautiful Clydesdale horses,,,,,
You all should bring Chell to Bartlesville to the Kiddie Park. She would love it!,,,,,
Her face is hilarious when she makes the fish face. :D,,,,,
I just love watching your posts.,,,,,
Wow that pretty awesome and she is cute..,,,,,
I love turtles too,,,,,
Now I wanna go to the zoo but it's pretty hard to get to here,,,,,
Was Cory right is she still doing it?,,,,,
Oh my goodness LOVE it fishy lips!,,,,,
So cute!!! I love you guys so much!,,,,,
Chell is getting so big. 😊 👍,,,,,
Love the zoo video,,,,,
cool love you guys i watch every video,,,,,
A BOAT :),,,,,
Well,,,,,
Desalination pump,,,,,
I would bring Corey Williams,,,,,
We're naked? Then I'd definitely have to bring a rubber.... ducky. You know,,,,,
A tarp! Protection form the dun,,,,,
Condoms,,,,,
Are multitools allowed? A decent sized multitool can get a lot done. Hope they bring a tarp.,,,,,
I would say a boat but depends,,,,,
Mine is Aug 3rd I'm  Duck...,,,,,
A cruise ship,,,,,
If stranded in the middle of the ocean,,,,,
A working emergency radio of some sort to get me some help and get me outta there,,,,,
Sun screen,,,,,
Desalination pump and a tarp. Cause my vampire butt does not do well out in the sun at all. I can go out for 15-20 min and I look like a cooked lobster etc.,,,,,
A vollyball,,,,,
If you mean an island,,,,,
A knife I mean what else are you going to use to kill things with and open things with :o,,,,,
Like floating in the ocean?cus I'd bring a GPS eperb beacon. If on an island I'd bring a good sharp knife,,,,,
I'll bring a TARDIS if I can bring anything I want.,,,,,
The desalination pump,,,,,
It depends on the design of the raft ,,,,,
"A big towel. Multipurpose ""Don't Panic"" device 😉",,,,,
Food.,,,,,
Rubber sex toy.  Uhhh,,,,,
When is your episode of Naked and Afraid?,,,,,
Totally freaked out just now seeing you on Shark After Dark. Lol so happy.,,,,,
Just saw you Cory and yes you were getting eaten alive by bugs Dang they were worse than Chiggers in Texas and Oklahoma,,,,,
Watching you right now. <3  My son thought it was really cool that we watch you on YouTube and now we can see you on TV. LOL,,,,,
Saw you on tv tonight 😊 But OMGGGG! I can't believe the bugs you had to endure on Naked and Afraid! That looked like hell to me! 🐛🐜🐍🦂🦎🐝,,,,,
I am so sad. We don't have cable...I watch everything on youtube. Someone will have to tell me what it was like.,,,,,
You are such a natural on camera way to go .....I hope you showed Chell daddy on TV with Sharks,,,,,
His episode  airs Sunday July 30th,,,,,

MY EPISODE AIR DATE: http://bit.ly/2tbaSCG,,,,,
Please read article again... it is NOT on the 3rd.... their episode is on the 20th......  The 2 night special with the sneak peak of DARKNESS is on the 2nd and 3rd....,,,,,
August 3rd for those who don't wanna click the link!! I'm super excited!,,,,,
On August 3rd at 9 PM ET/PT,,,,,
Is Cory and Corey the same name?,,,,,
Be very careful clicking this link,,,,,
Cory,,,,,
With my luck,,,,,
very confused  .  so when is the show going to air.,,,,,
I'm confused are you next week before the July 30 season 8 premier or are you Aug 3?  If so yikes!  2 more weeks without your stuff?  At least you have tons of time to paint!,,,,,
is there any way to watch this in Europe via stream or something? :'D,,,,,
If you don't want to click the link,,,,,
The real question is; will they let you air this on your YouTube site after its release? Some of us don't have cable/satellite to watch discovery channel on.,,,,,
Wow. Day before my birthday. Nice early present lol. Can't wait,,,,,
Is it the 3rd or the 20th?  NAKED AND AFRAID also gave YouTube star Corey Williams and pro surfer Anastasia Ashley the opportunity of a lifetime to see if they had what it takes to conquer 14 days in the wild. The two stars documented their intense NAKED AND AFRAID Fan Episode across social media. Fans of the series could catch daily highlights and low points of the NAKED AND AFRAID survival journey in real time. On August 20th at 9 PM ET/PT,,,,,
Way to go.  Thanks for letting me know.  Hope you are enjoying your new home and proximity to family.  Take care!  🔅,,,,,
Yay!!! My two favorites! Naked and afraid and Corey! Awesome!,,,,,
Is there any way to watch your episode if you live in the UK and don't have sky?,,,,,
"omg was laying here half asleep and clicked on FB and saw your post and thought it said ""My naked ass:  and I sat straight up LOL",,,,,
ok finally found the link. I had no problems going to it and nothing alerted on my computer....so feel pretty safe. :),,,,,
Cory can't wait to see your episodes  of Naked and Afraid ! your New House is Beautiful .,,,,,
I can never watch naked an afraid online in canada on their site . It is so frustrating when I miss an episode. Do you know if episodes will be added to youtube,,,,,
Cory this is kind of an early birthday present for you isn't it? Cool.,,,,,
I don't watch TV,,,,,
Are they two hours long or one? So it airs at 9? And it's a 2 night event? Currently at a halfway gone and tv is off at 11!,,,,,
I'm sorry you will leave Alaska but I'm happy that you and your family are happy. But hey...totally random question but are you ever thinking about visiting Scandinavia with the family in the future?,,,,,
You should take a little trip to the Caribbean! When Chell is a little older!,,,,,
I would be happy if I could be your neighbor,,,,,
Will you visit one of the national parks? I ahve traveled to USA with friends awhile back and they were awesome,,,,,
Hey Cory!!  Was wondering ~ if you don't mind answering,,,,,
did u think about getting a little tree or so with you to plant at the new house to take a little part of Alaska with you ?,,,,,
I love your channel. I watched the original mean kitty and loved it. All these years later you give me something positive to look forward to every day. Thank you!,,,,,
I am so looking forward to watching your family make some hella awesome memories. It's been a very hard couples weeks for myself and your family brings so much light into my life.,,,,,
Watching your drive through Edmonton... It confused me,,,,,
Loveed your Alaska vlogs. I'm from northern BC,,,,,
Thanks for sharing your adventures,,,,,
I am going to miss your Alaskan vlogs but so excited to know that Oklahoma vlogs are coming!! I am a North Texan who has family in Oklahoma and I am going to love seeing all the cool places you'll find!,,,,,
My husband thought he was still young enough to jump over a waist high fence. He discovered that he isn't spry enough for that anymore!,,,,,
It's a wonderful house you picked! My partner and I are looking for to buy property out in the open in Minnesota or North Dakota,,,,,
I'm sad as well for you to leave Alaska but it is your life and family is so very important. You'll do great no matter where you live and I will keep watching.,,,,,
As sad as I am that you've moved,,,,,
Did you guys are the fires when you drive through BC? Northern Bc is my home,,,,,
What youre goign through with mexican food in alaska,,,,,
I love that you are just sweet real and down to earth you and your wife too I just love you all and enjoy watching Chell she is so precious ...always much love,,,,,
it's amazing to see you evolve over the years,,,,,
corey,,,,,
Come visit Keenesburg Colorado!! Don't know if you're still looking for cool town slogans but it's the home of 500 happy people and a few soreheads,,,,,
I drive a 2012 Focus! I love it,,,,,
cory i remember watching way before alaska and I'm glad to see how great things have been going. I wish you nothing but the best on this new adventure <3,,,,,
Since you guys are moving to Oklahoma,,,,,
What glacier is this. I loved Alaska. Was only there for couple years but I hope to move back again someday!!,,,,,
Cory why do you walk like that when you have chell  on your back?,,,,,
Oh,,,,,
My husband took our daughter in the ocean for the first time I snapped a photo of them together as the sun was setting it was just so perfect she was just hugging him and telling him about the sharks,,,,,
You right i just found out today me and my girlfriend are having a little baby boy,,,,,
I wish I had a chance to meet you guys. I hoped that you guys were going to stay in Alaska the whole summer because I was I going to eat on vacation for the long time,,,,,
Ah I loved this glacier when I visited 😊 we climbed up all the rocks and got super close it was awesome!,,,,,
Dang Alaska is beautiful for sure!,,,,,
Looks like you got the shoes just in time.,,,,,
The air looks so fresh!,,,,,
This is one of the places we would like to go to with you when you come!!!! Soda Holt,,,,,
Whoa!  Love it - is Cory's fly  unbuttoned?  Also,,,,,
Wow,,,,,
Was that done in California?  Also,,,,,
There are some things you can't UNsee....LOL,,,,,
I would have liked to have said being out in nature naked changed you but this is you completely XD,,,,,
I think Corey needs to be in the next magic Mike lol,,,,,
I'm crying. This is absolute gold. Show this to Chell when she is older. Also Kristen,,,,,
Lol I thought Kristen was funny on too much coffee but this is priceless! Chell sweetheart,,,,,
How funny,,,,,
Wear tighter pants and grab some boots and you'll be ready for the south with those moves. 😂  -Born Texan,,,,,
Just imagine if someone walked up where he was dancing and was like ummmm what are you doing? Do you need help?,,,,,
LOL! I was watching without the sound and thinking,,,,,
This was the first thing I saw on FB when I woke up haha. Best way to start my day is by laughing XD,,,,,
Show this one to Chell when she is 15. Bet she's gonna love it 😂😂 you really got some great moves Cory 💃🏻,,,,,
Wow that was a bit to much Cory I see you as a brother or good friend a family man it was hard to watch don't get me wrong it's funny but awkward at the same time.,,,,,
People say I am weird. Of course I am,,,,,
Haha I watched this without the sound and it perfectly matched the music I was listening to (still of the night by Halestorm),,,,,
Nicole Owens Charise Curda why is this making me laugh so much??,,,,,
OMG ! Some of those moves shouldn't be made public ! Lol,,,,,
LOL ..Remember this the first time round ! The Harlem Shake on was good too !,,,,,
Excellent Cory! You said you were doing some sort of 'inspirational' 😍😍😍😇😀😳project a loooong time ago and these looks to be an example of it :),,,,,
There is a small part of me that has come away from this feeling a little little bit dirty,,,,,
You're a little rusty Cory,,,,,
Dear Cory.  I love this! 😍😂😍😂😍 How about you doing a comedy-style Magic Mike dance? 😉👍,,,,,
Yay,,,,,
Hey Cory!! You can come out summers and visit the lake...that is what you both were planning right? Visiting Alaska once in a while after moving?,,,,,
You should come to Norway! 🇳🇴 The nature in Alaska is alot like the nature in Norway! 😍 The big mountains 🏔,,,,,
Hi Son,,,,,
Can you give a thumbs up for watching while in the hospital?,,,,,
This is where you were skipping rocks?? That's when I discovered y'all.,,,,,
My brother and I used to go fishing there. Miss the beauty of Alaska. Need to come home for a visit!,,,,,
Start looking forward to the new home and surroundings,,,,,
Awwww Cory. Just think you'll always have the videos to remember it by! ♥  You'll have new adventures to take you many a more gorgeous places just like your favorite Lake!,,,,,
Hey Cory just remember when you guys leave you and your family can find new adventures go on and make even more memories to cherish. love your videos by the way. Lots of love man,,,,,
If ever in Salt Lake City,,,,,
YOU SHOULD JUST STAY IN ALASKA UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE ALL OF THE THINGS. CLEARLY THERE IS STILL WAY TOO MUCH GOING FOR YOU THERE,,,,,
Don't cry because it's ending,,,,,
I love the reflection on the lake. I can see why Alaska has gotten deep into your heart.,,,,,
The memories will always be there and you have video of this too. You can always go back and visit.,,,,,
I love the little lake just down the road from our place here in the Yukon,,,,,
HI CORY ,,,,,
Agree w/the Colorado comment,,,,,
There is a grieving process and it is normal and you are doing it all the right way.❤️,,,,,
ironic that the stream of the cool sound lake is frozen itself ;P,,,,,
Another new adventure for you and your family,,,,,
Cory know that you and your family has helped me emotionally and mentally and that I will continue to watch you,,,,,
You'll have many more opportunities to make more memories wherever you end up. Stay positive. ❤️,,,,,
Leaving is hard,,,,,
We'll miss seeing you guys in Alaska but I'm so excited to see what you do next,,,,,
Dang it's so light there still! It's ten at night here and time for bed!,,,,,
And you'll be missing this in the Lower 49!,,,,,
and the artificial turf has been reborn as a moosie wrestling mat😀,,,,,
hi Cory,,,,,
Glad you found something to do with that old astroturf. <3 Love it,,,,,
Thank you Cory and Kristen for sharing this beautiful video,,,,,

So the moose family is okay??????,,,,,
Mmm septic tank grass.... is that the leach field?,,,,,
My favorite part of living in Alaska is seeing all the new little baby animals everywhere. God,,,,,
Good Morning from the Netherlands. Great video off mama Moose and the little ones. Thank you. 👍,,,,,
how are you guys ever going to leave Alaska when you see stuff like this!??!?,,,,,
I hope she has made sure the kids have done their chores and homework before deciding to watch TV with the kids. XD,,,,,
Omg that's cool seeing the moose up to the window looking in and her babies are cute that was a beautiful view on video to see Cory,,,,,
I am so very happy your moose wasn't the one who was killed! Watching her and her babies is so much fun! I love watching your vlogs & keeping up you,,,,,
Thank you for the Moose Cam!!! I love seeing all of your Alaska stuff,,,,,
Thank you for sharing this awesome experience with us!,,,,,
If Cory and Kristen move to OK,,,,,
I'm really going to miss your moose videos when you move. They are so cute!,,,,,
I'm so sorry. People are dumb. I'm glad you have happy videos of them. ❤️,,,,,
I guess the moose wanted to see what's inside the house. I bet someone (who's going to get your house) would love to enjoy getting up close to a moose as much as you do.,,,,,
Backseat gamer! (the moose) :p,,,,,
I just watched the live video! Hi from Pennsylvania. :) Love you all!!,,,,,
Those baby moose are so adorable. Thanks for the live video,,,,,
"""No.. no... human... don't go in there... go to the left.... ughhhhhhh .. just gimme the controller... "" hahahahahahahaha",,,,,
Do you ever go out and let them see you on the deck?,,,,,
That is awesome!!,,,,,
Wish I had Moose peering in my window ..no moose in the UK !,,,,,
So cool,,,,,
Wow those babies are growing ! What a treat,,,,,
My sons (ages 4 and 1) love to watch your videos and come running when they hear your intro. The 1 yr old loves to dance to your intro! Love your positive attitudes and love for life.,,,,,
That's a really good redneck Alaskan voice! It really is too bad your moving!!,,,,,
I'm happy for you guys no matter what your plans may be. Cory... you are absolutely one the most genuine,,,,,
You need to do a moose video like this,,,,,

Plesse dedicate something to the Caribbean Islands-all who are in the midst of such devastation. Peace,,,,,
I'll see you October the 6th here in Atl.,,,,,
Look how he easily raised over 100k this way. If we could do more like these to help the homeless and veterans it would help so much. I love this kickstarter but their are so many garbage ones that pull in a lot of cash. If everyone donated 10 dollars we could easily raise 500,,,,,
Hope he appreciates all the love and money people donated to this Album and pays it forward to other charities and causes. I know he got to making something on tour,,,,,
What does a $100,,,,,
Can't wait to see you in Ohio! Love to you brother!,,,,,
Feel shamed that because I have bad credit and don't own a credit card,,,,,
Love being part of this. Thank you brother. 💜,,,,,
Wow...Carl et al...We were at the Boulder concert and thought it was wonderful...even a few tunes in encore when Trevor was obviously very sick. The minute he walked on stage we knew something wasn't right. Any doctor would have said cancel the night,,,,,
I like that title,,,,,
How do I get my mp3 files I pledged on kickstarer?,,,,,
My fiancé supported the kickstart and bought us tickets for 9:30 club! Best Birthday present ever! We wish you all the luck in achieving your goals!,,,,,
I will definitely do this later today. I love your music Trevor. It heals me on my dark days and reminds me of who Iam,,,,,
So,,,,,
I can't wait for you to come to Atlanta!! So excited to soak in the LOVE!😍😍😍,,,,,
I absolutely love your music,,,,,
I cannot wait for this album.,,,,,

I Have been a waylens user since the beginning of the Kickstart.Had a small issue it was my fault I missed an email sent within a few hours to fix the problem.This is a stand up company and do what they can to make us all happy.I am not a dealer being paid or nothing given just received awesome treatment from there team day 1.Thanks Waylens.,,,,,
Is it just a security camera (for when stationary) or also a dash-cam (used for when driving)?,,,,,
Very nice I am waitting,,,,,
I want 1 where can I purchase one?,,,,,
Do you have a go pro mount,,,,,
How much,,,,,

Yes yes yes!!! I wanted something like this and y'all did it!,,,,,
Features,,,,,
When,,,,,
How much?,,,,,
How high of heat can it take?,,,,,
Looks like you can only mount this device once right? Why not have it with a suction cup device? Good product though I plan on getting it.,,,,,
That will make a nice addition to my Waylens camera.,,,,,
I drive a dodge magnum. Going to fabricate a spot just for this on my vehicles ceiling! Can't wait!!,,,,,

"My cat ""Fish"" is the same way when its bathtime.   ... Except less jovial meowing when she hears the tub running.  ... And less cooperation and calm attitude.  ... And more claws. ... And flailing.  ... You get the idea.   Okay so she's not like Pumpkin at all for bathtime and I'm super jealous.",,,,,
